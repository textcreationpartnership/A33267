            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> whose Canons and Decrees were ever reverenced by the more impartial sort of men, has met with such an Ʋniversal Acceptance, that it has been the Study of the most Learned of divers Nations to christen it into their Mother Tongue. The <hi>Italian</hi> Author, the incomparable <hi>Peter Soave,</hi> was so generally received, that it encouraged the most Learned <hi>John Deodati</hi> to Translate it into <hi>French,</hi> and our Country-man, Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> to make it speak <hi>English;</hi> the last of which we are obliged to thank, as having given us the opportunity of being acquainted with those remarkable Transactions which passed in several Nations before the Session of the Council, as likewise the various Policies to impede or further its Convening, the different Interests of the persons to be assembled, and the wonderful Progressions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that at last brought it to pass; and lastly the several Disputes and Controversies were held and discussed in the Synod, about the most important affairs, relating to Religion, and its Reformation.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Observation of a great States-man, that sundry peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple assembled together to <hi>work</hi> the same end, do not always <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> it with the same end: Lines which meet all in one
<pb facs="tcp:102311:3"/>point, go not all the same way; they often meet and yet differ. Many Stones of not above three inches thick, may raise a height of a thousand yards; but the uniting of many Wits, serve not to the Advancement of one Ʋnderstanding; instead of helping, they hinder one another: To which he adds, That in all Assemblies there cannot be so good Resolutions had, but will become bad, if observed but by a Few; nor none so bad, which may not prove exceeding good, if observed by All: Wise men, indeed, ought to counsel the best, yet sometime follow the worst, if the worst be the Opinion of the most.</p>
            <p>But with my Authors leave, this Rule is not general, and therefore may admit of an Exception; for if two Eyes joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, see more than a single one, and that some harsh Notes in Musick are not only allowable, but renders the Harmony the more delectable and pleasing, so it be followed by a Concord: Councils then, or general Assemblies are the most proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to find out Errors, and their Determinations are the most solid, and challenge a greater Veneration and Submission, which have been hammered out by severe Disputes, and by mature Judgements throughly refined.</p>
            <p>Of all things in the World, Religion is of the highest Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and in matters relating to Religion, Councils have ever born the greatest Sway; and it is observable, Events have been the consequent Proofs of the infinite Blessings that attend them. It is the Pleasure of some men to blame the Sun, because it offends their Eyes, and know not that the fault lyes in their Eyes, and not in the Sun. It has been the humour of some to cry down the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> without considering the Reasons which could induce them to it; as indeed it is natural to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise
<pb facs="tcp:102311:3"/>what we do not like. But the World would be highly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to that Author, who would shew a way or means, how Envy and Malice might be avoided, when the Subject is capable thereof.</p>
            <p>The History of this Council, every one knows was written by an accurate Pen, and as to Matters of Fact, relating what passed between the Members of that Holy and Oecumenical Synod, and their several respective Principals, and what was materially debated and concluded in every Session, was drawn to the Life. But as to those Canons and Decrees, those holy Sanctions and Ecclesiastical Constitutions which were ordained, set forth and established, in the several Sessions, celebrated under those three famous Popes <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>III. Julius</hi> the <hi>III.</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>IV.</hi> It was impossible to set them down at length, as not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Book so voluminous, and therefore the Author was obliged to an Epitome or Abstract of them, and so pass them over.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, considering how great a Vogue this Council hath in the World, and how necessary it would be to communicate those Canons and Decrees, which are the general subject of the great Disputants and Champions for Religion, and never appeared in this Country but in a <hi>Roman</hi> Dress; I ventured to send them abroad now in an <hi>English</hi> Garb, hoping they will meet with a candid and ingenious Reception; to which I have added a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of those Illustrious Persons which compos'd that Sacred Assembly. The Translation is plain, and suited to the Idiom of the Canon Law as near as could be; following the ancient and best Edition of <hi>Paulus Manutius, qui puros Canones, &amp; ipsa Concilii decreta praemisit,</hi> saith <hi>Chiffletius,</hi> who published the pure original Canons and Decrees, without the Annotations of succeeding Commentators. These are they that have been so
<pb facs="tcp:102311:4"/>highly and generally recommended by so many Learned Men for many ages; the testimony of one of which I shall take leave to conclude with, <hi>Ea sunt,</hi> saith he, <hi>quae quotidie legi merean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, imo nunquam de manibus nostris deponi,</hi> &amp;c. They are such as deserve to be read every day, yea never to be laid aside out of our hands; that as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, we may by a daily perusal of them be able to hold fast the faithful Word, as we have been taught, that we may be able by sound Doctrine, both to exhort and to convince Gainsayers.</p>

               <p>IN the beginning of this our Prelacy (bestow'd on us by the great goodness and providence of Almighty God, rather than our own merits) seeing into what State our Pastoral care and vigilance is brought, by reason of these troublesome times, and ill Order of things in General; We have desired a Redress of those Grievances of our Common-wealth, wherewith it has of a long time been pester'd, and almost over-run; and We our self, but a Man, and subject to Infirmity, have thought our self not able to go through with so great an undertaking: For, understanding that a Peace was necessary towards the preservation, and freeing of the Common-wealth from the many Impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dangers, we met with nothing but Dissention and Hatred; more especially, Princes disagreeing among themselves, who have (as it were) the ordering of almost all things, committed to them by God: And thinking that there was but one Sheep, and one Pastor of the Lords Flock necessary for the purity of the Christian Religion, and the hope of the Faithful, which, we thought, was establish'd in us, we (contrary to our expectation) found the name of <hi>Christian</hi> almost rooted out, and the Unity of the Christian Religion shaken with Schisms, Divisions, and Heresies crept in amongst us; at what time we wish'd heartily the safety and firm defence of the Common-weal from the Arms and Insidious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102311:8"/>of <hi>Infidels;</hi> for through our own mistakes in General, (Gods wrath due to our Sins, impending, or hanging over our heads) <hi>Rhodes</hi> was lost, <hi>Hungary</hi> very much pester'd with a Foreign Enemy, who likewise have thought upon, nay, even begun another, and that both by Sea and Land, with <hi>Italy, Germany</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia:</hi> At which time, that Infidel the Turk, our immortal Enemy, deemed it his meetest opportunity to effect his design upon us, we being at Enmity and Dissention among our selves.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as we have said, in such a Cloud of Heresies, Divisions and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and such Commotions amongst us, seeing we are call'd to sit at the Helm, as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, to guide and govern the Ship; and not trusting too much in our own strength, we besought God that he would Succour us, and Aid us with his Counsel and Wisdom: Thereupon, revolving in our mind, how our Ancestors, indued with admirable Wisdom and Sanctity, have thought Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils, and General Assemblies of Bishops, to be the best Expedient in such imminent Dangers of the Christian Common-wealth, we likewise have purposed the holding a General Council; having first of all consulted the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Princes therein, which to us seem'd to be of Chief Importance and Concern in this matter; and when we found them not at all strange to so Holy a Work, we order'd an Oecumenical Council and General Convention of those Bishops and Fathers to whom it belong'd, to be held at <hi>Mantua,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1537. and the third of our Pontificat, to begin the 10th of the Kalends of <hi>June,</hi> as our Letters and Monuments show, being fully perswaded that when we were there jointly assembled in the name of God, the Lord, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he has promised, would be present in the midst of us, and of his goodness and mercy, by the mouth of his Holy Spirit, easily dispel those storms and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that threaten us.</p>
               <p>But, the Devil is always busie to frustrate the pious Intentions of Mankind; for quite contrary to all our hopes and expectations, <hi>Mantua</hi> was deny'd to us, unless upon terms altogether differing from the Institutions of our Ancestors, the Condition of the Times, and the Dignity and Liberty of our Holy See, and Title Ecclesiastick; all which we have express'd in our other Letters: Wherefore we have found it absolutely necessary to find out some other place or City; which, seeing we cannot presently meet with, fit to our purpose, we have been forc'd to Prorogue the Celebrating this Council till the Kalends of <hi>November</hi> following: In the mean time, our immortal and perpetual Enemy, the Turk, is fallen upon <hi>Italy</hi> with a vast Fleet, and has already Taken, Sack'd and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd some Maritime Towns in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and led away Captive the Inhabitants; we, in the general fear and danger, have been busied in Fortifying our Sea-Port Towns, and Assisting our Allies: Nor did we forget to consult and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat our Christian Princes to give us their Opinions, which place they esteem'd most fit for the holding a Council in; but, seeing they were uncertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consentaneous, and the time withal protracted longer than needed; we, out of our good Intention, and, as we deem, Wisely, have made choice of <hi>Vincentia,</hi> a City very plentiful, and enriched with the Vertue and Authority of the <hi>Venetians</hi> (who were the first Founders of it, and gave us the Liberty) having an open access to it, and Station in it free for all comers, yet very well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102311:8"/>defended. But, when the time was yet longer protracted, and it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to signifie to all the Election of a New City, the near approach of the Kalen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of <hi>November,</hi> and the Winter Season drawing nigh, hinder'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation thereof; so that we were again constrain'd to defer the meeting of the Council till the next Spring, on the Kalends of <hi>May:</hi> Wherefore that we might make firm the Constitutions and Decrees, as well as make ready our selves, and all other things pertaining to the Celebration of this Council, we have consider'd how much it would conduce to the welfare, as well of the Celebration of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as of the whole Christian Republick, that the Christian Princes be at Peace, and agree together amongst themselves; I mean our dearly Beloved Sons in Christ, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and <hi>Francis</hi> the most August and most Christian King, the two prime Pillars and Supporters of the Christian Name, whom we intend to pray and beseech to come to discourse it between themselves before us, having already courted the one as well as the other, both by our Letters, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's, and Legats, chosen out of the number of our Venerable Conclave; very often solliciting them, that, laying aside all Dissimulation and Treachery, they would enter into a firm League and holy Amity, and so lend their aid to the Redress of the Christian Religion, now a sinking; telling them, That (seeing God had especially put the power into their hands) if they did not do it, and contribute all they could to the common good of Christians, they would be forced to give a strict account of all their proceedings, to that God, who had intrusted 'em with it: Who, listening to our intreaties, appointed a Meeting at <hi>Nice,</hi> whither we undertook to go, (a long Journey and very much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with our Old Age) for God's sake to conclude on a Peace between them: Not forgetting in the mean time, when the time of the Meeting of the Council, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> drew near, to dispatch Three Legats of great Vertue and Authority, out of the Number of our Cardinals <hi>(viz.) S. R. E.</hi> and send them to <hi>Vincentia,</hi> that they might there begin the Council, and receive the Bishops at their coming from all Parts; and Empower'd 'em to do and handle what they judged most convenient; to the end that we, being return'd from our Journey of Negotiating the Peace, might act all things with less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and difficulty. And in the interim we did what in us lay, in that good and highly necessary work of mediating a Peace between the two Potentates. God is our Witness, how we expos'd our self in our Journey to the Clemency of the Sea, with the great hazzard of our Life. Our Conscience can witness for us, that he have not pass'd by any thing, nor left one Stone unturn'd, that might conduce to the uniting of them. The two Princes themselves will witness, whom we have so often and so earnestly entreated by our Nuncio's, Letters, Legats, Admonitions, Perswasions, and all manner of Intreaties, to lay by their old Grudges, and become Friends; that by their joint Counsel and Forces they might aid and assist the Christian State, now in the greatest and most imminent Danger. Yea, those very Watchings and Troubles by Night rolling in my mind, and and those Cares and Pains by Day, which for this very Cause and Matter we did Undergo, will also witness for us: Nor yet for all this are our Councils and Actings brought to the wished Period: So has it seem'd good to the Lord God, who, we yet hope will look more favourably upon those our hearty Desires:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102311:9"/>For, we have omitted nothing in this Affair which was either in our Power, or belonged to our Pastoral Function to do. And, If there be any that misconstrue our Intentions of Peace, we are sorry for it; but even in the midst of our Sorrow we give the All-powerful God thanks, who for the like example and Doctrine of Patience, counted his Apostles worthy, who for the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is our Peace, suffered Scorn and Reproach. But at our meeting and in our discourse which we had at <hi>Nice,</hi> although, (by reason of our Sins) a true and lasting Peace could not be concluded between the two Princes, yet a Truce of Ten years was agreed on; by which means we hoped both the sacred Synod would be more commodiously Celebrated, and also that by the Authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the Union would be fully perfected; to which end we appointed the two Princes to be both present themselves at the Council, and to bring their Bishops, they had with them, along with them: Who when they had excused themselves as to both; that of necessity they must return to their respective Kingdoms; and that the Prelates they had with them, being weary of their journey and expences, ought to refresh and recreate themselves, intreated us to put off the meeting of the Council till another time. To which we were not easily brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, receiving Letters in the mean time from our Legats at <hi>Vincentia,</hi> the day for the Meeting of the Council being already gone and past, whereby we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that not above one or two out of Foreign Nations did appear in Council at <hi>Vincentia.</hi> Having received this News, and seeing no likelyhood of having a Synod at that time, we yielded to the two Princes, to put off the Celebrating a Council till <hi>Good Friday</hi> next, and the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, which is the day of the Resurrection of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>The Decretal Letters of this our Order and Expectation were made publick at <hi>Genoa,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1538. and on the Kalends of <hi>July;</hi> and we the rather made this Dilatation, because each of the Princes did promise us to send Ambassadours to us at <hi>Rome,</hi> that what was wanting towards the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Peace, and could not by reason of the shortness of the time be effected at <hi>Nice,</hi> should be handled and discussed before us at <hi>Rome;</hi> and for this very reason also both of them begged of us, that this Peace might be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on before we took care for the meeting of the Council, and that the Council, the Peace Concluded, would act more profitably and better for the Christian-Weal: Always the hope of the Union of these two Princes induced us to assent to their desires, which hope mightily increased by the benevolent and amicable meeting of them after our departure from <hi>Nice;</hi> which when we understood, it mightily increased our joy, and confirm'd in us good hope, that God had at last heard our Prayers, and accepted of our Vows. Upon this conclusion then of a Peace, which we so much coveted and urged, not only with the two before, mention'd Princes, but also with our most beloved Son in Christ, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> seem'd to depend the Celebrating of the Council; and all of them by their Letters and their Orators have interceded with us for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Council to another time; but chiefly the most Serene <hi>Caesar,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make it his business to make some kind of a Peace with those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from the Catholick Unity, which he could not fitly do before his journey into <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102311:9"/>
               <p>We, still led on with the hopes of a Peace, and the desire of Uniting so many Princes, especially when we saw that the Prelates did not appear at <hi>Vincentia</hi> a second time, upon the Feast of the Resurrection aforesaid, so that now quite banishing the Name of a Prorogation, which we had repeated so long to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, we resolv'd to suspend the Celebration of the General Council during our pleasure, and that of the Apostolical See: So we did, and thereupon dispatch'd our Packets to each of the aforesaid Princes, bearing date the 10th day of <hi>June</hi> 1539. as may be clearly gather'd out of the said Letters. This suspension therefore was made by us of necessity, till a more fit season, which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us when the Peace should be concluded on, which would afterwards procure both Dignity and Frequency in the Council, and bring a readier remedy to the Christian-weal: But the State of Christendom did every day grow worse and worse, the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> after the Death of their King, calling in the <hi>Turk;</hi> King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made War upon them; and some part of the <hi>Belgii</hi> stirr'd up to a Revolt from <hi>Caesar:</hi> To quell which Revolt, the most Serene <hi>Caesar</hi> went over into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> (taking his way through <hi>France,</hi> saluting the most Christian King in his passage, most kindly and friendly, there appearing great Tokens of good will between them) and from thence into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he assembled the Princes and Citizens to treat of the Peace, as he had said. But when (all hopes of a Peace failing) we saw that the treating of Peace in the Assembly did rather stir them up to greater Discords; we were forced to return to our old Remedy, a General Council, which we obtained of <hi>Caesar</hi> himself by our Legats, the Cardinals <hi>S. R. E.</hi> which we did last of all, and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Council of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> when our beloved Son <hi>Gaspar S. Praxedis,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Contarene,</hi> a man of great Learning and Integrity, acted in quality of our Ambassador there. When that which we were afore affraid of was desired of us at the Request of the Council, namely, that we would declare some Articles of the Dissenters from the Church, to be tolerated, to the End that it might be discussed and decided by an Oecumenical Council, a thing which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Christian and Catholick Verity, nor our Dignity, nor that of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical See could admit of, we openly commanded it to be proposed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as was the way heretofore. Neither indeed were we ever in any other mind or Opinion, but that an Oecumenical and General Council should be assembled when it was first propos'd by us; for we hoped for Peace among Christians, and the Purity of Religion to be regain'd thereby.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this, we fain would have, together with the Union of the Christian Princes; which Union of theirs while we expect, we but wait for an unknown time, the time of thy Good pleasure, O God. We are sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to discern that all time is well pleasing to God, when we consult about things Sacred and belonging to Christian Piety: Wherefore seeing (indeed with great grief of Heart) the Christian Religion to grow every day worse and worse, <hi>Hungary</hi> over-run by the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> in great danger, and all the other Countries afflicted with Fear and Sadness, we have determin'd not to ask the Advice of any Prince, but to attend the good will of Almighty God, for the Advancement and Protection of the Christian-weal. Therefore when we could have <hi>Vincentia</hi> no more, and did yet desire to consult the General Good of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102311:10"/>Christians, as also the Inconveniences of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, in Electing a Council to be held in some place or other by us; and some places being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, we seem'd to desire of them the City <hi>Trent:</hi> We, although we judged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We consider'd upon the day for the meeting of the Council, that we might have space to publish this our Intent throughout all Christian Nations, and give all the Prelates timely notice that they might prepare themselves to attend: But that we might not consume the whole year in changing the appointed place for the Council, as has been done in some other Constitutions; and the reason is, because we were not willing any longer to delay the hopes of curing in some part the Christian State, which is afflicted with so many Detrimental Damages and Calamities; and yet we have an Eye to the Times: We acknowledge the Difficulties; what can be hop'd for from our Councils, we confess is but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: But because it is written, <hi>Make known thy way unto the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it,</hi> we have resolv'd rather to trust to the Mercy and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, than distrust our own weakness: For in the beginning of good works, it often happens that what humane counsel cannot effect, the Divine power may: Therefore fraught and assisted by the Authority of that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and by the Authority of his blessed Apostles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose Authority we bear upon earth, together with the Counsel and Assent of our Venerable Brothers, Cardinals, <hi>S.

First of all, that they take special care of this (which they may very easily do) that in their respective Kingdoms and Provinces, they take care that the Bishops and Prelates without Tergiversation or Delay, do come to the Council; which thing, the <hi>German</hi> Prelates and Princes ought chiefly to thank God and Us for; seeing it was chiefly for their sakes, and at their Request that this Council was called, and that in that very City which they desired it might be called in; therefore let them not grumble to grace and adorn it with their general Presence, whereby those things that belong to the Integrity and Verity of the Christian Religion, the Reduction of Good, and the amendment of ill Manners, the Peace, Unity and Concord of Christians among themselves, as well Princes as People may the better and more commodiously be effected, and furnish us with means for the repelling the Forces of <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> who strive to take away Christianity Root and Branch, still setting God before us in our Consultations, and carrying the light of his Wisdom and Verity in our Hearts, to act in the said Sacred Oecumenical Council; and with the Charity of all, to consult, handle, perfect, and bring to the desired ends as soon and as well as possibly they can. And that these our Letters, and that which is contain'd in them, may come to the Ears of all who are concern'd, and that none may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Ignorance, and seeing especially that there cannot be a free access unto all who are concerned in them, We Will and Command, That one of the Clerks of our Court, or some publick Notary, go incontinent to the <hi>Vatican</hi> and <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Church, and there in the midst of the people, which flock thither in great numbers to hear Divine Service, Read them with a loud Voice, and afterwards fix them upon the Doors of the said Churches, as likewise at the Entrance of the <hi>Apostles Chancel,</hi> and in the wonted place in the Field of <hi>Flora;</hi> where let them hang to the view and notice of all for some time: and when they shall be taken down, let there be left fastened in the same places, things in Imitation thereof: For we; by the Reading, Publication, and Posting up of these our Letters, do command and appoint, That all and every whom our Letters aforesaid do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, shall, in the space of two months after the Publication and Affixion hereof, be bound and obliged to appear, as if they had been read and intimated to each particular Person: And that it shall be lawful for none to infringe, or boldly to contradict this our Bill of Indiction, Annunciation, Convocation, Statute, Decret, Mandate, Precept and Request: But if any will be so hardy as to presume to meddle with it, let him know that he will incur the Displeasure

                  <p>THE thrice Holy Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assembled by the power of the Holy Ghost, the three chief Legats of the Apostolick Seat presiding in it, doth acknowledge with our blessed Apostle St. <hi>James, That every good and every perfect Gift, is from above, descending from the Father of Lights, who giveth to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that asketh of him plenty of Wisdom, not stinting them;</hi> and knowing withal, That <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom,</hi> did Order and Decree, That all and every Christs Faithful assembled in the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to amend all the Errors and Enormities of their past Life, and for the future to walk in the Fear of the Lord, and not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh, but be instant in Prayer, Confess their Sins often; Receive the Sacrament of the Blessed Eucharist, Frequent Churches, and lastly, as far as every one is able, to fulfil the Commandments of the Lord, as also daily to pray for the Union of Christian Princes and the Church, privately in their Closets: It does also order, that all the Bishops and others of that Sacred Function, assembled in the said City to Celebrate the Oecumenick Council, be instant in the Praises of Almighty God, in offering of Sacrifices, Prayers and Praises, at least wise to offer up the Sacrifice of the Mass every Lords Day, the day whereon he rose from the Dead, and sent his Holy Spirit into his Disciples; and let them be careful, as the same Spirit by the Apostle hath taught us, that Prayers, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and giving of thanks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> made for his Holiness the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for Kings, and others in Authority, and likewise for all Mankind; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, and live to see the Increase of Faith amongst us: Moreover they order, that people Fast at least the Six days set apart for the Passion of our Saviour; and that they be charitable to the poor: And in the Cathedral Church shall be celebrated every Fifth Holy day the Mass of the Holy Spirit, with Letanies, and other Prayers for that end Instituted; and in other Churches, let there be said, at least, the Letanies and Prayers for the Day: And in the time of Divine Service, let there be no talking or discoursing together, but be assisting both with Heart and Voice in the Celebration.</p>
                  <p>And because it behoves Bishops to be without blame, sober, chast, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over their charge, it advises, that above all things, every one be sober and moderate in his Drinking and Eating at Table. Furthermore, seeing it very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls out that idle discourse does happen in that place, the Council doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that some portion of Scripture be read even at the Bishops Tables; and Teach and Instruct all their Domestick Servants and Family not to be Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Drinkers of Wine, Immodest, Covetous, Proud, Blasphemous and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102311:12"/>of pleasures: Last of all, let them shun Vice, and imbrace Vertue, and in their Apparel, Worship, and in all their Actions, let them carry themselves honestly as becomes Ministers of the Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, since it is the chief Care, Trouble and Intention of this most Holy Synod, that the Dark Chimera's of Heresies being dispell'd, which for so many Years have cover'd the Face of the Earth, the Light of the Catholick Verity, by the Assistance of Jesus Christ who is the true Light, may again show its self in its Splendor and Purity, and that those things that want a Reformation may be Reformed; the said Synod doth intreat all Catholicks here Assembled, and to be Assembled, especially those skill'd in Sacred Writ, that they would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider with themselves, by what ways and means this Assembly may best carry on their intention, and chuse the way that leads to the desired effect, whereby things to be condemned may be condemned the sooner and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideringly, and things to be approv'd of Approv'd; that all the World with one Voice and one Confession of Faith, may glorify God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>But in delivering their Opinions, according to an order of the Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the Ministers of the Lord sitting in the place of Benediction, ought not by immodest words to make a noise or tumultuously disturb him that speaketh; nor ought any one to hold an obstinate contest about false and frivolous matters, but that whatever is spoken, may be done with that mildness, as may neither offend the Auditors, nor make them warp in their judgments.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore this Holy Synod hath decreed and appointed, That, if by chance any one not seated in convenient place, yet desire leave to give his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any point for the good of the Assembly, or any other Acts whatsoever, during the sitting of the Council, should not prove a prejudice to, or be pleaded for as customary by any one.</p>

                  <p>THE most Holy Oecumenick and General Councils of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully met together in the Spirit of Holiness, the Three Legats of our Holy and Apostolick See presiding in it, considering the Weightiness of the Matters to be discussed, especially of those contain'd in the Two Chapters of the Extirpation of Heresies, and Reforming Manners, for which two causes alone it was chiefly call'd; yet acknowledging with the Apostle, that <hi>we strive not against Flesh and Blood, but against Spiritual Wickednesses in high places,</hi> when at the same time, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102311:12"/>indeed principally he exhorts them <hi>to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his Might, in all things taking upon them the Shield of Faith, whereby they may extinguish all the fiery darts of the Wicked, and put on the Helmet of Salvation, with the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi> Therefore, that this pious care by the Grace of God might not fail in the progress of its Intention, above all things, they appointed and ordered Confession of Faith to be made, following in this the example of their Predecessors, who were wont in their more Holy Councils, first of all, before they acted any thing, to put on this Shield against Heresies; by which very means alone, they have sometimes drawn Infidels to the Faith, confuted Hereticks, and confirm'd the Faithful: Wherefore the Confession of Faith, used by the Holy Catholick Church, is, as it were, the Principle, in which all who profess the name of Christ, necessarily agree, and thought fit to express a firm and sole Foundation in those very words read in all Churches, against which the Gates of Hell shall never prevail; and which here follows.</p>
                  <p>I believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one Substance with the Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was made Man, and was Crucified for us under <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate.</hi> He suffer'd and was buried, and the Third Day he rose again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the Right Hand of the Father. And he shall come again with Glory, to Judge both the Quick and the Dead: whose Kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is Worshipped and Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who spake by the Prophets. And I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the Remission of Sins. And I look for the Resurrection of the Dead, and the Life of the World to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>A Decree concerning Canonical Scripture.</head>
                  <p>THE most Holy Oecumenick and General Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> assembled lawfully in the Spirit of Holiness, the aforesaid Three Legats of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See presiding therein, having this always before their Eyes, That all Errors being taken away, the Purity of the Gospel might be preserved in the Church, which promise was delivered to us before, by the Prophets in the Old Testament, and delivered again anew, by the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, the only begotten Son of God, who afterwards commanded his Apostles to go preach it unto all Nations, as the only Saving Truth; and seeing this Verity and Discipline is contain'd in the written Word, and in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions of the Fathers, which the Apostles receiv'd from the mouth of Christ himself; and descended down to us from the Apostles themselves, who had it dictated to them by the Holy Ghost, following the examples of the Orthodox Fathers of the Church, and reverencing all the Books, as well of the Old as New Testament, of both which God is the immediate Author; as also the Traditions themselves, belonging both to Faith and Manners; dictated as it were from the Mouth of Christ, or of the Holy Spirit, and preserved in the Catholick Church in a continual Succession; Hath therefore thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to publish a Catalogue of those Holy Books which are Canonical, lest possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there might arise any doubt about it, which they were the Synod approv'd of as such: Of which take the following Account: Of the Old Testament, the Five Books of <hi>Moses, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;</hi> then <hi>Joshua, Judges, Ruth,</hi> the Four Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> the Two Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the First and Second Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Hesther, Job,</hi> Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> in number an Hundred and Fifty; Proverbs of <hi>Solomon, Ecclesiastes,</hi> or the Preacher, <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon, Book</hi> of <hi>Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and the Prophesie of <hi>Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> the Twelve Minor Prophets, <hi>viz. Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Naum, Habakkuck, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachiah,</hi> and the two Books of the <hi>Macchabees.</hi> Of the New Testament, the Four Evangelists, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> writ by St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist; the Fourteen Epistles of St. <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> 1 to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 2 to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> 1 to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 1 to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 1 to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> 2 to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 2 to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 to <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and 1 to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> 2 Epistles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 3 of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 of St. <hi>James,</hi> 1 of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and 1 of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> And if any one, reading over these Books in all their parts, as the custom is in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> being in the old vulgar Latin Edition, does not hold them for <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Canonical;</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102311:13"/>knowing the before specified Traditions, does industriously contemn them, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> or accursed. Every one therefore may be satisfy'd in what order and manner the said Synod, after having laid the Foundation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, will proceed, and what Testimonies and Authorities they will chiefly make use of in confirming their Opinions, and restoring Orders and Manners in the Church.</p>

                  <head>A Decree about the Edition and Ʋse of the Sacred Text.</head>
                  <p>MOreover, the said most Holy Synod, considering how it would not a little contribute to the Welfare of the Christian State, if, of the many Editions of the Bible, one only were pitch'd upon as Authentick, hath therefore appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared, That the Ancient and Vulgar Edition, for so many Ages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd of in the Church, be held as Authentick in publick Lectures, Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Preachings and Expositions; and that none presume to reject it upon any pretext whatever.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, for the restraining of Petulant and Saucy Wits, the Council does Decree, That no man presume upon his own prudence in matters of Faith and Manners, such as appertain to Edification, wresting the Holy Scriptures to speak his own Sense against that which our Holy Mother the Church hath, and does hold, to whom it of right belongs to judge of the true Sense and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Holy Scriptures; or, against the unanimous consent of the Fathers, dare put his own Interpretation upon Holy Writ, even although those their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations should never be made publick: The Ministers of their respective Cures shall declare it, if they know any that contradict this our Order, that they may undergo the punishment according to Law in that case provided.</p>
                  <p>But being herein desirous to limit the Printers, who, without any Order, that is, supposing themselves to have liberty to print what they please, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permission of their Superiours in matters Ecclesiastick, do print the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bible it self, and that with Annotations to it, and Expositions, without ever considering what they do, nay very often by a private and unlawful Press; and which is still more grievous, without the Authors Name; and being, thus print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do sell them in some other Country for fear of a discovery: This Council doth order and appoint, That for the future, the Sacred Scripture, especially this Ancient Vulgar Edition, be most exactly printed; and that it be lawful for none to print, or cause to be printed, any Book touching things Sacred without the Authors Name; nor afterwards vend them, or keep them by them, except first examined and allowed by the Ordinary of the place, under the pain of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> or Curse, and a pecuniary Mulct, as was order'd in one of the Canons of the last Council held at the <hi>Lateran.</hi> And notwithstanding the Regularity thereof, they shall not print them, till they have first had the Licence of Superiours after they have narrowly view'd them over, according to their Orders. The Authors likewise that communicate and divulge their Copy to them, before it be first examin'd and approv'd of, shall be liable to the same punishment with the <hi>Printer.</hi> And that they who shall have, or read such
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102311:14"/>Books, unless they can discover the Author, shall be held Authors thereof themselves. And this Examination of Books, shall be given in writing, and prefix'd in the Front of the Book, either written or printed, that it may appear to be Authentick, or with Allowance; and all this, that is, both the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Licence shall be done freely and for nothing; that so those that are approv'd of may be Licensed, but those that are not allow'd of, to be refused. After all this, willing to amend that too much boldness of some who turn every thing to prophane uses, and make the words speak their own sense, turning the Holy Scriptures, forsooth, into Scurrilities, Fables, Vanities, Flatteries, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, Superstitions, Wicked and Diabolical Incantations, Divinations, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, and Infamous Libels; it doth command and appoint, for the removing all irreverence and contempt of this Nature, that none for the future dare any ways pervert the Sacred Text, to these or the like ends; that all such Men, rash Interpreters and Violaters of the Word of God, his Power and good Pleasure, shall be punished at the Discretion of their Bishops.</p>

                  <p>THat our Catholick Faith, without which it is impossible to please God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from all Errors, may remain in its purity, whole and uninfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lest the people of God should be carried about with every wind of Doctrine; and seeing that Old Serpent, the immortal Enemy of Mankind, amongst the many Evils which disturb and infest the Church of God in these our times, hath also renew'd his old wiles about Original Sin and the Remedy thereof; this thrice Holy, Oecumenick and General Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assembled in the Holy Spirit, the said three Legats of the Apostolick See pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding therein, for the recalling such as do err, and the confirming such as do waver, following the testimonies of Sacred Scripture, holy Fathers, and most approved Councils, and the judgment and consent of the Church, hath thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and confessed its Opinion concerning <hi>Original Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any does deny, the first man <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had disobey'd Gods command in Paradise, did thereupon immediately lose that Sanctity and Integrity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was created, and for his prevarication did incur the Displeasure and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Almighty God, and consequently Death, which God threaten'd him withal if he did transgress, and with Death, Captivity to him that had the power of Death, that is, the Devil; so that the whole Man, for this offence, both
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102311:14"/>Body and Soul, were changed for the worse; Let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> or Accursed.</p>
                  <p>If any one affirm that <hi>Adam's</hi> Prevarication did only reach to himself, and not to his Posterity; and that the Holiness and Integrity which he lost, he lost only as to himself and not as to us; and that through that cursed Sin of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience temporal Death and Punishment of the Body was brought upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and not that Sin which is the Death of the Soul; Let him be <hi>Anathema;</hi> For he plainly contradicts the Apostles, Saying; <hi>By one man Sin entered into the World, and by Sin Death, and so Death hath passed upon all men, in that all have sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one do affirm, That this Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which originally was proper to him only, and transmitted unto all by Propagation, not Imitation is become proper unto all, can be taken away by the meer strength of humane Nature, and other means, than the Merit of our only Mediator Jesus Christ our Lord, who reconciled us unto God by his blood, and who obtain'd for us Justification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption, and denies the Merit of Jesus Christ to be apply'd to the Adult as well as Infant in the Sacrament of Baptism, according to the Custom of the Church; Let him be <hi>Anathema;</hi> because, <hi>There is no other name under Heaven given to Men, whereby they may be Saved:</hi> whence follows that saying; <hi>Behold the Lamb of God: Behold him that takes away the Sins of the World:</hi> and that other: <hi>Whosoever ye are that have been Baptized, have put on Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one denies the Baptizing of little Infants, even although born of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Parents; or says, That indeed their Baptism is for the remission of Sins, but that they contract nothing of Original Sin from <hi>Adam,</hi> which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the obtaining Eternal Life to be washed away in the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; whence it must necessarily follow, That the Form of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is not really for the Remission of Sins, but otherwise; Let him be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed: Because that of the Apostle is to be understood no other ways; <hi>By one Man sin entred into the World, and by Sin came Death; and so Death hath passed upon all Men, in that all men have sinned,</hi> and which the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> diffused over all the World, did so understand. By reason of this Rule of our Faith, from the Tradition of the Apostles, even little children, who could not as yet be guilty of any Sin of their own, are truly Baptized for the Remission of Sins, that by Regeneration that might be done away in them, which was contracted by Generation: <hi>Except a man be born again of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one deny the Guilt of Original Sin to be forgiven by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ which is conferred in Baptism; or else asserts, That the true and proper cause of Sin is not wholly taken away, but says it is only pass'd by and not to be imputed; Let him be accursed: For God hates nothing in his Regenerated ones: <hi>Because there is no Damnation unto them, who are truly buried with Christ by Baptism unto Death:</hi> Who did not walk according to the Flesh, but putting off the Old Man, and putting on the New, which is created after God, being innocent, undefiled, pure, unblameable, and made the beloved of God, and heirs of God, &amp; Joint-heirs with Christ, nothing will absolutely hinder their entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Nevertheless, this Holy Synod does confess and believe that there remains a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102311:15"/>Concupiscence, or, as it were, a Spark in the Baptized, but being so little it is not able to hurt them, if they do not give it ground, but advantageously resist it through the Grace of Jesus Christ: For <hi>he that strives lawfully shall be Crowned.</hi> This Concupiscence which the Apostle somewhere calls Sin, this Holy Synod declares that Holy Church never understood or call'd it a Sin, which truly and properly is a Sin in the Regenerate, but because it is of Sin and inclining to Sin: And if any are of a contrary opinion to this, Let them be <hi>Anathema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The said Sacred Synod doth furthermore declare, That it was not in the least their Intention to comprehend in this Decree, concerning Original Sin, the Blessed and Undefiled Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of God, but that the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Pope <hi>Xystus</hi> IV. of Blessed Memory, be observ'd, under the penalties contained in the said Constitutions.</p>

                  <p>THe before-specify'd most holy Synod, assisting, embracing, and contributing toward the pious constitutions of the chief Bishops and their approved Councils, lest that divine Treasure of Sacred Writ, which was freely deliver'd unto men by the Holy Ghost, should be neglected, have Order'd and Decreed, That in those Churches, in which there is a Prebendary or Priesthood, or any other Salary, by what name soever call'd, belonging to the Lectors of Divinity, the Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Primates, and others of an Inferiour Rank, shall urge and compel those who have such a Prebendary, Vicarage, or like Salary, to apply themselves to the Exposition and Interpretation of Scripture, if they be abilited thereto; otherwise the Bishops, Arch-bishops, Prelates, and others of an inferiour rank, may take his Benefice from him, and substitute another more fit in his place: Moreover we decree that this Prebendary, Vicarage, or other Salary be not bestowed on any persons, but such as are well qualified thereto; if such a one cannot be got, that then, making some other shift, the place to become void. That in Metropolitan Churches or Cathedrals, if in a great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous City, as also in Colleges in some great Towns, and belonging to no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Seat, if the Clergy be therein numerous, and no Prebendary, Vicarage, or other such like place of Salary be there found, the first Prebendary that on any wise becomes vacant, (except by Resignation) may be understood to belong to him properly, who is not ordain'd for some other Benefice. But if there be no Prebendary in those Churches, or, if one, not sufficient, then a Metropolitan, or Bishop, to add thereto the Salary of some other single or small Benefice; or such as are already Benefic'd in the City or Diocess, to contribute towards the endowing of it; or else some other way, as shall seem more convenient: Thus taking care, with the advice of their Chapter, that the Reading of the holy Scripture may be had publickly, but so, that no other Lectures whatsoever, by Custom, or any other Reason, constituted, be in the least thereby hindred. But let those Churches whose Benefices are but small, and the Clergy and People
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102311:15"/>but few, so that Divine Service cannot conveniently be had, at least have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster chosen by the Diocesan, together with his Council of Deans and Prebends, who may teach the Clergy and other poor Scholars, the Art of Grammar, that thereby, by Gods Grace, they may apply themselves to the study of Scripture, requiring nothing therefore but the income of his School, and the small Benefice, which they shall allow him as long as he continues in that office, not defrauding him of the benefit thereof as long as he continues obsequious in his Duty: Or let a certain Stipend be paid him from the Chapter or Bishops Table: Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise let the Bishop himself think upon something for the good of his Church and Diocess, that so pious, so necessary and so profitable a design may not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected upon any pretence whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Let Scripture likewise be read in the Monasteries of the Monks, if it can be done with convenience; in which matter, if the Abbots shall be remiss, then the Bishops of the places, Delegates herein of the Apostolick See, may compel them thereto as they shall see fit. Let it likewise be read in the Conventions of other Regulars wherein there is a conveniency for Study: The which reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture let it be assign'd to the worthy teachers thereof by order of general or provincial Chapters: Let it likewise be set up in publick Schools, wherein it has not been yet read, by the Piety and Charity of the most Religious Princes and Commonwealths, for the Defence and Increase of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith, and Preservation and Propagating of Sound Doctrine: and restore it again where neglected. And lest under a Pretext of Piety Impiety be disseminated, the said Holy Synod hath decreed, That none be admitted to this office of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer either publickly or privately, but, who have been first of all examin'd by the Bishop of the Place, as to his Life, Manners and Understanding, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of; which must not be understood of those who read in the Cloysters of the Monks.</p>

                  <p>LET those likewise who have taught Scripture publickly in Schools, and those Scholars who study in the said Schools, fully enjoy and obtain all the priviledges granted them by common Right of Receiving the fruits of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries and other Benefices in their Absence. And because the Preaching of the Gospel is no less necessary for the good of the Christian Common-wealth, than the Reading thereof, the ordering whereof is solely in the hands of the Bishops, this said Sacred Synod hath order'd and decreed, all Bishops, Archbishops, Primates and other Prelates of the Church, bound personally, unless lawfully hindred, to preach the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ themselves. But if it so fall out, the Bishops, or other the aforesaid, be lawfully detain'd, they shall be bound according to the order of this General Council, to make choice of fit men, to perform the Office of the Ministry to Edification. But and if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to fulfil this our Order, let him undergo the punishments in that case pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. Arch-Presbyters also, Plebans and all Parochials, or others that have the care of Souls, shall in their Respective Churches, in their own persons (or by others fit, if lawfully hindered) feed the Flock committed to their charge,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102311:16"/>with wholesome Words, according as they are able, at least on <hi>Sundays</hi> and the Solemn Feasts, teaching them those things which are necessary to be known to Salvation, telling them with what brevity and plainness they are able, what Vices they are to avoid, and what Vertues they are to follow, that they may escape eternal Punishment, and obtain everlasting Life; which, if any one neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do, pretending that for some reason he is exempt therefrom by order of his Diocesan; and although some Churches should some way or other be exempt, as belonging to some Monastery, which if it be within the limits of the Bishops Diocess, his Pastoral Care ought not to be wanting therein; lest that saying be fulfilled, <hi>The Little ones asked for Bread, but he was not found that could give it them.</hi> Therefore after they have been admonish'd by the Bishop of their Non-Residence for the space of three Months, let them be restrain'd by the Censures of the Church, or otherwise at the pleasure of the Bishop, that so, if he see it expedient, some reasonable Salary be paid to another out of the Emolument of the Benefice, who may perform the Office until they Repent and Return to their Charge again. But and if there be any Churches found belonging to Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that are included in no Diocess, if the Abbots and Regular Prelates be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the before-mention'd office of Preaching, they may be compell'd by the Metropolitans, who, as to this matter, are, as it were, the Delegates of the Apostolick See, and in whose Provinces the Diocesses themselves are; And neither Custom, nor Exemption, nor Appeal, nor Recantation, nor Recourse, may hinder the Execution of this Decree, until the matter be examin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by a competent Judge, that may proceed summarily, and with respect to the truth of the matter. Regulars also, of what order soever, may not Preach, not even in the Churches of their own Order, till they have been first of all Examin'd as to their Life, Manners, and Knowledge, and approv'd of by their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and have their Licence: With which Licence they are bound to appear before their Bishops personally, and ask their Blessing before they may begin to Preach: But in the Churches, which are not of their Order, and beyond the Power of their Superiours, Let them be oblig'd to receive Licence from the Bishop; without which they may by no means preach in those Churches: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Bishops shall Licence them <hi>gratis.</hi> But if the Preacher, which God forbid, shall disseminate Errors and Scandals among the People, and though he preach in the Monastery of his own or another Order, the Bishop may sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend him from his office of Preaching; But if he has preach'd up Heresie, let him proceed against him according to Law, and the Custom of the place, even although the Preacher should pretend himself exempt by a general or special Privilege; for in such a case the Bishop may proceed by the Authority of an Apostle, and as delegate of the Apostolick See. But let Bishops be careful, lest any Preacher, vex'd by false Informations, or otherwise calumniated, have a just cause to complain.</p>
                  <p>Let Bishops also have a care that they admit not any of those who are call'd Regulars, and live out of the Cloysters, and are not obedient to their Religion; nor Secular Presbyters, unless noted and approv'd of for their Manners and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to preach in their City or Diocess, under pretext of certain Privileges, unless they have first of all the Popes leave so to do, from whom 'tis very likely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102311:16"/>these unworthy men cannot obtain those Privileges, unless by concealing the truth, and telling an express lye. But Eleemosinary Quaestors, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tradesmen, of what condition soever they be, may by no means, either by themselves, or another, presume to preach, or do or act contrary to the Bishops or Ordinaries of places, and notwithstanding some Privileges, may be instantly restrain'd by some seasonable Remedy.</p>

                     <p>FIrst, this Holy Council does declare, That it is necessary, truly and well to understand the Doctrine of <hi>Justification,</hi> that every one acknowledge and confess, That through <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression all men had lost their Innocence,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102311:17"/>and become sinful, and, as the Apostle has it, <hi>by Nature the Children of Wrath;</hi> and as we expounded it in the Decree of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> were so far servants of Sin, and under the Power of the Devil and the Grave, that not only the Gentiles by the force of Nature, nor indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Letter of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> could free themselves therefrom; although their Free-will was not altogether extinct in them, though lessen'd and decay'd in its Vigour.</p>

                     <p>WHereby it came to pass that our Heavenly Father, the Father of Mercies, and God of all Consolation, sent his Son Jesus Christ (so often promised when the fulness of time should come, and spoken of by the holy Patriarchs both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and under the Law) amongst men, that he might as well redeem the <hi>Jews</hi> that were under the Law, as make the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who knew no Justice, to do just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all to receive the Adoption of Sons.

                     </head>
                     <p>MEN are design'd to Justification, when quickned and assisted by the Divine Grace, and receiving Faith by the Ear, they are freely mov'd in God, believing those things to be true which are promised and divinely reveal'd; and that is the first step to the justification of the Wicked by the Grace of God, and the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus; and while they know themselves to be sinners, and through fear of the Divine Justice, wherewith they are profitably mov'd, begin to resolve to cast themselves on Gods Mercy, being elated with hope, trusting that God will be favourable unto them for Christ's sake; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to love him the Fountain of all Justice: And thenceforward they are mov'd with a certain hatred and detestation of Sin, that is, by that Penitence which ought to exert it self before Baptism: Lastly, while they resolve upon Baptism, to begin a new Life, and keep Gods Commandments. Of this Disposition it is thus writ, <hi>He that draws near unto God, must believe that he is; and that he is a Rewarder of them that seek him:</hi> And, <hi>Be of Faith, Son, thy Sins are forgiven thee:</hi> And, <hi>The Fear of the Lord putteth away Sin:</hi> And, <hi>Repent and be baptized every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102311:18"/>one of you, for the Remission of your Sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I have commanded you:</hi> And lastly, <hi>Prepare your hearts unto the Lord.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>JUstification it self follows the before-said disposition and preparation, which is not only the Remission of Sins, but even the Sanctification and Renovation of the inward man by a voluntary receiving of Grace, and giving of Alms: Whence a Man of Unrighteous is made Righteous, of an Enemy a Friend, that he may be heir of the hope of Eternal Life: The causes of this Justification are <hi>final;</hi> The Glory of God and Christ, and Eternal Life. But the Merciful God is the <hi>Efficient Cause,</hi> who does willingly cleanse and sanctifie, signing and anointing with the Spirit of Promise, or of the Holy Ghost, who is the pledge of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; the <hi>Meritorious Cause,</hi> is the most beloved and only begotten Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ; who, when we were Enemies, out of the Ardent love, wherewith he loved us, by his most Holy passion upon the Wood of the Cross merited our Justification, and made satisfaction to God the Father for us. The <hi>Instrumental</hi> cause is the Sacrament of Baptism, which is the Seal of Faith, without which no man was ever saved: Lastly, the <hi>Formal</hi> cause is the Justice of God; not that whereby he himself is just, but that whereby he justifies us; with which being indowed by him, we are renewed in the Spirit of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and we are not only reputed, but we are called and really are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, receiving Justification in our selves, every one according to his measure, as the Holy Ghost pleases, and according to the proper disposition and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every one: although that none can be Justified, to whom the merits of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ are not communicated; which is done in this Justification of the Wicked, while by the merits of his most Holy passion, the love of God by the Holy Ghost is poured into their Hearts, who are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and remain therein: whence by this Justification and Remission of sins, man had all these infused into him, as Faith, Hope, and Charity, by Jesus Christ: For Faith, unless Hope and Charity be likewise added, does not unite us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with Christ, nor make a lively Member of his Body; for which reason it is most truly said; That <hi>Faith without Works is Dead</hi> and vain; And, <hi>In Jesus Christ neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision, but Faith, which works by Love.</hi> The Catechumens receive this Faith from the Tradition of the Apostles, before they receive the Sacrament of Baptism, when they ask Faith, and Eternal Life, which Faith without Hope and Charity cannot acquire: And in mediately after there follow the words of Christ; <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</hi> Therefore, they, who receive true and Christian Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in their infancy, instead of that which <hi>Adam</hi> lost both as to himself and them, are commanded to continue in that Righteousness pure and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102311:18"/>bestow'd on them by Jesus Christ, and bring it along with them before the Tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they may have Eternal Life.</p>

                     <p>NEvertheless, no man, notwithstanding he is justified, ought to deem himself freed from keeping the Commandments; nor ought any to use that rash saying, prohibited by the Fathers under a Curse, <hi>That the Precepts of God are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be kept by a Righteous man;</hi> for God does not command Impossibilities, but bids us do what we can, and beg his assistance in what we cannot, and he will help us: <hi>Whose Commandments are not grievous, whose yoke is pleasant, and whose burthen is light:</hi> For they that are the Sons of God, love the Son Christ Jesus; and, They that love him, as he himself witnesses, keep his sayings; which, with the Divine Assistance, they may perform. And, in this mortal life, though men be holy and righteous, they may fall into small daily Sins, such as are call'd Venial, yet nevertheless not cease to be Righteous: For that saying of the just is lowly and true, <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses:</hi> Whence it comes to pass that the Righteous should think themselves so much the more bound to walk in the ways of Righteousness, seeing they are freed from Sin, and made the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, to live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly, and prevail through Christ, by whom they had access unto the state of Grace: For God does not forsake those who have been once justified by his Grace, unless they first forsake him: None therefore ought to comfort himself up with Faith alone, thinking that thereby he is made an Heir, and will obtain an Inheritance, even though he does not suffer with Christ, that he may be Glorify'd with him; For even Christ himself, as the Apostle speaks, though he was the Son of God, <hi>yet learned he Obedience by the things which he suffer'd: and being made perfect, became the Author
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102311:19"/>of Salvation unto all them that obey him:</hi> And to this purpose it is that the Apostle admonishes the Righteous, saying; <hi>Know ye not, that they, who run in a Race, run indeed all, but one receiveth the Prize? So run that ye may obtain: I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one beating the Air: but I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection; lest that by any means, when I have Preached to others, I my self should be a castaway:</hi> The Prince of Chief or the Apostles also, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> says; <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and Election Sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fail.</hi> From all which it is plain, that they repugn the Doctrine of the true Religion, who say, That the Righteous sins at least ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially in every good work which he does; or, which is still more intolerable, That he deserves Eternal punishments: And those likewise, who say, That the Righteous do sin in all their Works, if they have an Eye to the Eternal Reward, by rouzing up their Sloth, and resolving to run the Race, with this opinion, that God is principally thereby Glorify'd: As it is written, <hi>I have inclin'd my heart to thy righteous Judgments for the recompence of Reward.</hi>

                     <p>SEeing then, that when men are upon this account Justified, they will either constantly keep the grace received, or recover it when lost; we are to set before us the words of the Apostle: <hi>Abound in every good Work, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord: For God is not unrighteous to forget your Work and Love, which ye have shewed toward his name. And cast not away your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which hath a great Reward.</hi> And therefore Life Eternal is set before them that do good, and hope in God to the end, and Grace is mercifully promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Sons of God through Christ Jesus; and is faithfully to be given them as a reward for their good Works and Merits; (even as he himself hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.) For this is that <hi>Crown of Justice</hi> which (as the Apostle says) after his Fight, and the Finishing of his course was laid up for him, by the just Judge, and not for him only, but for all those that love his appearing. For when Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (as the Head to the Members, or the Vine to the Branches,) doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infuse Vertue into the Justified; the which Vertue doth always go before, Accompany, and Follow after their good works; and without which they could by no means be Acceptable with God or Meritorious: We must then believe that nothing more is wanting to the Justified whereby they may be thought truly to have satisfy'd the divine law as to their state in this life, and to have merited Eternal life in its due time (if they depart in Gods Favour.) When Christ our Saviour saith: <hi>If any man shall drink of the water that I shall give him he shall thirst no more; but the Water which I shall give him shall be a Well of Living Water springing up to Eternal Life.</hi> So neither is our Righteousness to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us, nor must the righteousness of God be neglected or rejected. For that which we call our Righteousness, is so called, because by that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness inherent in us we are justified; that same Righteousness of God is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called because it is pour'd into us by God through the merits of Christ: But neither must we forget that, which is so absolutely attributed to good Works in Holy Scripture: That he that shall but give a Cup of cold Water to any the least of his Disciples, Christ does promise he shall not lose his Reward. And the Apostle witnesseth, That that which is but a light and momentary Affliction here, works in us an exceeding weight of Glory in the Heavens: But God forbid, that a Christian Man should either trust to, confide, or glory in his own strength, and not in the Lord, whose goodness toward all men is such, that he would have the good things which we injoy rather esteemed our own merits than his Rewards. And seeing <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> every one ought to have the severity and justice of God, as well as his Mercy and Goodness before his eyes; and no one ought to judge himself guiltless, though he finds nothing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102311:21"/>faulty in him: Because the actions of men are not to be examin'd and judg'd by humane judgment, but by God; <hi>who will bring to light things hid in Darkness, and make clear the Councils of the Heart:</hi> And then every one shall have praise of God, who, as it is written, <hi>will give to every one according to their Works.</hi>

                     <p>To this Catholick Doctrine about <hi>Justification,</hi> which except every man firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes, he cannot be Justified; it hath pleased this Sacred Synod to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join these following Canonis, that all may know, not only what to hold and follow, but also what to reject and shun.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102311:23"/>People, thought fit to begin with those of the first Rank in the Church. For the Integrity of the King, or such as are in Authority, is the safety of their Subjects. Confiding therefore in the mercy of the Lord our God, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Vicar upon Earth, that it will so happen, that the government of Churches, because it is an undertaking too weighty even for Angels to bear, that those who are indeed worthy, whose former life, and all their days, from their very Cradles even to their riper Years, can give a good testimony by the Fruits of their Discipline, commendably produced in the Church, may receive that Charge, according to the Venerable Sanctions of the Blessed Fathers; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth, and will have advised, all the Praefects in Patriarchal, Primatical, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical and Cathedral Churches whatsoever, by what Name or Title soever call'd, that taking heed to themselves, and the whole Flock, in which the Holy Ghost hath put them, they may be careful in governing the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his Blood; as the Apostle teacheth, Let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in all things, and accomplish their Ministery. But let them know that they can in no wise accomplish it, if they as hired Servants forsake the Flocks that are committed to them; and be not in the least careful to keep the Sheep, whose Blood by the Supreme Judge will be required at their hands: Whereas it is most certain the Shepherds excuse will not be admitted, if the Wolf eats the Sheep and the Shepherd knows not of it. And nevertheless because some persons (which is a very dolorous thing) are to be found at this time, who preferring Earthly things before Heavenly, and Humane things before Divine, wander about in diverse Courts, or having left their pastoral care, busy themselves about Earthly things: It pleased this Holy Synod to renew those ancient Canons pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished against those who did not Reside, (the which Canons by the Injuries of Men and of the Times, are grown out of use;) nevertheless by Vertue of this Decree, this Council doth renew them: And further for the firmer residence of them, and the Reforming manners in the Church, in this form following doth Ordain and Establish.</p>

But Contumacy increasing, so that it must be offer'd to the more severe Censure of the Sacred Canons, the Metropolitan in the Absence of his Bishops Suffragans, or the Eldest Bishop Suffragan in his Metropolitans Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence shall be oblig'd, under pain of being deny'd Entrance into the Church for it, within three months to declare the same to the Pope, either by his Letters or Messenger: Who by the Authority of his Supremacy may inflict a penalty upon such as are Absent, according to the greatness or smallness of their Offence, and provide better Pastors in the Church, as he shall see good in the Lord.</p>

Seeing that in the by-past Sessions the Seven Sacraments of the New Testament in general, and in particular, Baptism and Confirmation were treated of, the Council doth now determine that the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, as also of such things as belong to Reformation, and the more easie and commodious Residence of Prelates, ought to be treated of and discussed: And it doth advise and beseech all Fathers in the mean while, according to the example of our Lord Jesus Christ, as far as humane frailty will admit, to addict themselves to Prayer and Fasting, That God, being at last appeased, to whom be Glory for overmore, would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to bring mens hearts to the knowledge of the true Religion, the Unity of our holy Mother the Church, and to a Right Rule of Life.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN the first place, this holy Synod doth teach, and openly and simply profess, That, after the Consecration of the Bread and Wine in the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Eucharist, our Lord Jesus Christ, truly God and Man, is Indeed Really and Substantially contain'd under the <hi>Species</hi> of those sensible things: Neither are these things contradictory in themselves, That our Saviour may always sit at the right hand of God in Heaven, according to the Natural way of Existing, and that his Substance should nevertheless be present with us Sacramentally in many other places, by that same manner of Existing; which, although we can scarce express it in words, yet it is possible to God, and our imagination being illustrated through Faith, we may follow, and ought most firmly to believe it: For so all our Predecessors, as many as were of Christs true Church, and have writ or discours'd upon this most holy Sacrament, have most clearly professed, That our blessed Redeemer instituted this most holy Sacrament at his Last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when after the Benediction or Blessing of the Bread and Wine, he witnesses in plain and perspicuous words, That he gave them his very Body and Blood: Whose words are recorded by the holy Evangelists, and afterwards repeated by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and seeing they carry in them that proper and most apparent significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to which the Fathers understood them, it is indeed a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable wickedness that they should be wrested by certain contentious and naughty men to fictitious and imaginary Tropes, whereby the Verity of Christs Body and Blood is deny'd, contrary to the universal opinion of the Church:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102311:34"/>which devilish comment invented by wicked men, as it were a Pillar and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Truth, this Council doth detest, always with a grateful and thankful heart acknowledging this most extraordinary Benefit of Christ.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>OUr Saviour, being about to depart out of this World to go to the Father, instituted this Sacrament, in which he, as it were, pour'd out the Riches of his Divine Love towards men, making a memorial of his Miracles; and he commanded us at his taking the Supper to reverence his Memory, and shew forth his Death, until he should come to judge the World: And he would have this Sacrament to be taken, as a Spiritual Food for the Soul, whereby they that live after Christ might be nourished and strengthned, who said, <hi>He that Eateth me shall have life through me;</hi> and as an Antidote, by which we are freed from our daily Trespasses, and preserved from deadly sins: Besides he would have it to be a pledge of our suture Glory, and perpetual Folicity; and by consequence a Symbol of that one Body, of which he is the Head, and to which we are bound as most strict members, by the Bonds of Faith, Hope, and Charity; that we might all jointly say, Neither were there any Divisions amongst us.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis indeed is common to the most Holy Eucharist with the rest of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, That it is the Symbol of a thing Sacred, and the visible Form of an invisible Grace. But it has that Excelling and Singular found in it, which the rest of the Sacraments only have in the using of them; it has in it, before used, the Author of Sanctity; for the Apostles had not yet received the Eucharist from the hand of our Lord, when he affirmed, That which he gave them was really his Body: And this belief was always in the Church of God. That presently after Consecration the real Body and Blood of our Lord, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, together with his Life and Divinity, under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine: But his Body indeed under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, and his Blood under the <hi>Species</hi> of Wine by the force of the Words; and the same Body under the <hi>Species</hi> of Wine, and the Blood under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, and the Soul under Both, by the force of that natural Connexion and Concomitance, whereby the parts of our Lord, who is already risen from the Dead, and shall die no more, are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled one with another: As also by that admirable Divinity of his with the Body; and Hypostatical Union with the Soul. Wherefore it is at length most true that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102311:34"/>he is contain'd under either or both <hi>Species;</hi> for whole and intire Christ exists under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, and under any part thereof; as also under the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of Wine or any part thereof.</p>

                     <p>AND because Christ, our Redeemer, did really call that his Body which he gave under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, it has therefore always been the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of God: And this Holy Synod doth now again declare, That by the Consecrating of the Bread and Wine, there is made a Conversion of the whole substance of the Bread into the substance of the Body of Christ, and of the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood: Which Conversion by the Holy Catholick Church is aptly and properly called <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is therefore no place of doubt remaining, but that all the Faithful in Christ, according to the Custom always received in the Catholick Church, give that Religious Worship which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament in Veneration: Nor is it therefore the less to be Ador'd, because it was instituted by Christ our Lord, that it may be received: For we believe him the same God present, which his Eternal Father bringing into the World, said; <hi>And all the Angels of God shall Worship him:</hi> whom the Wise Men falling on their Faces, Worshipped: whom lastly, Scripture witnesses, was Worshipped in <hi>Gallilee</hi> of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>This Holy Synod doth moreover declare, That this Custom was very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and religiously brought into the Church of God: That every Year on a certain Peculiar and Festival Day, this Holy and Venerable Sacrament should be Celebrated with Singular Veneration and Solemnity; and, That it should be carryed in Procession Reverently and Honourably through the Streets and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places: For it is most Just that there should be some Holy Days set apart, when all Christians by a singular and certain firm signification should shew themselves grateful and thankful to our Common Lord and Redeemer, for so ineffable and plainly divine benefit, whereby are represented the Victory and Triumph of his Death. And thus ought Truth to Triumph over Falsehood and Heresie, that its Adversaries seeing its so great splendor and general joy of the whole Church may, being weaken'd and shaken, come to nothing, or being affected and confused with shame may at one time or other repent.</p>

                     <p>THE Custom of preserving the Holy Eucharist in the <hi>Sacristy</hi> or Holy Place, is so ancient, that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> does acknowledge it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the carrying the Holy Eucharist to the Sick and Infirm has been a custom diligently preserved in the Church, being join'd both with great Equity and Reason, as also found commanded by many Councils, and very anciently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by the Catholick Church: Wherefore this holy Synod doth think this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom very wholsom and necessary to be kept.</p>

                     <p>IF it does not befit any one to come unto any Sacred Function, unless holily, surely the more the Holiness and Divinity of this heavenly Sacrament is in any Christian man, the more diligently he ought to take heed that he do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to partake thereof, but with great Reverence and Holiness, especially seeing we read such terrible words in the Apostle; <hi>He that eateth and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords Body.</hi> Wherefore he that has a mind to communicate must call to mind that Command or Precept; <hi>Let a man examine himself.</hi> And the Custom of the Church doth declare such Examination to be necessary, that none ought to come unto the holy Eucharist that are guilty of Mortal Sin, although he may seem humbled therefore, unless admitted by Sacramental Confession: Which this holy Synod hath decreed perpetually to be observed by all Christians, and by such Priests also whose office it is to celebrate, if so be a Confessor be not wanting. But if, upon urgent necessity, the Priest shall celebrate without previous Confession, let him do it with the first opportunity.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>AS to the Use of rightly and wisely receiving this holy Sacrament, our Fore-Fathers have laid down three Ways or Reasons: They taught that some
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102311:35"/>take it only Sacramentally, as Sinners; others Spiritually, those namely, who, out of earnest desire eating that holy Bread set before them, perceive the fruit and benefit thereof in a lively Faith which works by Love; and a third sort both Sacramentally and Spiritually, and those are they, who so try and examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before-hand, that having put on the Wedding Garment they may approach this holy Table. But in the receiving this Sacrament, it has always been the Custom in Gods Church, That Lay-persons should receive the Communion from the hands of the Priests, and that the Priests celebrating should communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which Custom, as descending by Apostolick Tradition, ought deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of right to be retained. Last of all, this holy Synod out of a Fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, doth admonish, exhort, beseech and intreat through the bowels of the Mercy of our God, that all and singular, who name the Name of Christ, may at last agree and meet together in this sign of Unity, in this Bond of Charity, and in the Symbol of Concord, being mindful of so great Majesty and so ample Love of Jesus Christ our Lord, who laid down his blessed Life, the price of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gave us his Flesh to eat; That they would believe and reverence these holy Mysteries of his Body and Blood with that constancy and firmness of Faith, with that Devotion of mind, with that Piety and Worship, that they may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently receive that super-substantial Bread, and that it may be to them indeed Life Eternal, and perpetual soundness of Mind; with whose Vigour being strengthen'd, they may be able from this Miserable Pilgrimage here to arrive in Heaven, to eat the Bread of Angels openly, which now they only eat under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Types.</p>
                     <p>But seeing it is not sufficient to speak the Truth, unless Errors be detected and refell'd; it hath pleas'd this holy Synod to subjoyn these Canons, That all who acknowledge the Catholick Doctrine, may also understand what Heresies they may be aware of and shun.</p>

                     <p>THe same holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assembled in the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the said Legat and Nuncio's of the Apostolick See presiding therein, intending to decree some things, that belong to the jurisdiction of Bishops, That, according to a Decree of the last Session, they may so much the more willingly reside in the Churches committed to them, by how much they may the more easily and commodiously govern them that are subject to them, and keep them in honesty of Life and Manners, that they may remember they are Pastors not Smiters, and that it behoves them so to be over their flocks, as not to domineer or lord it, but to love them as Sons and Brothers; that they may labour by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and perswasions to deter them from things unlawful; lest, when they have offended they be forced to restrain them by lawful and due Punishments: Whom yet, if they happen to sin through human Frailty, they shall hold to that precept of the Apostle, That they may reprove, entreat and check them in all Goodness and Patience; seeing it very often happens that good Will does more than Severity, Exhortation than Threats, Charity than Power, towards their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if the Lash must be made use of, by reason of the Greatness of the Offence, even then Rigor with Gentleness, Justice with Mercy, and Severity with Lenity or Meekness is to be used, that without asperity or harshness, wholesome and necessary discipline may be preserved among the People, and that they that are corrected may be amended; or, if they will not repent, the rest, by animadverting upon this example, may be deterr'd from Vices; seeing it is the office of a diligent and pious Pastor, to administer first of all gentle medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to the Distempers of his Sheep; afterwards, where the grievousness of the Disease so requires, to descend to more sharp and harsh remedies: but if even these do no good, at least to free the rest of the flock from the danger of Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by taking such from among them. Seeing therefore that the Guilty very often, to avoid punishments, and evade the censures of their Bishops, do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Complaints and Grievances; and by the protection of an Appeal do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the progress of Justice, lest the remedy instituted for the Defence of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, be abused to the Defence of Iniquity, and that this their Craft and Tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation may be put a stop to, it hath thus Determin'd and Decree'd; That there be no Appeal made in Cases of Visitation and Correction, or of Hability or Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nor in Criminal Cases, from the Bishop or his Vicar General in Spirituals, before definitive Sentence in case of Interlocution, or any other grievance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. And neither the Bishop nor his Vicar may deferr this Appeal as frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but, that, or any other inhibition, coming from the Judge of any Appeal, as also all Style and Custom, even time out of mind, to the Contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, may proceed to other things, if this sort of Grievance cannot be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102311:37"/>by a Definitive Sentence, or therefrom lie no Appeal: In which Cases the Decrees of the Holy and Ancient Canons stand good.</p>

                     <p>BEcause for feigned Reasons, which notwithstanding seem probable enough, it sometimes falls out, that some do extort favours by which the punishments, to be inflicted on them by the Just Severity of Bishops, are either quite remitted, or very much lessen'd; and seeing it is a thing not to be endured, that a Lye, which is so displeasing to God, should not only go unpunish'd, but also be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Excuse for the Commission of other offences; This Synod hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Determin'd and Decreed, as follows; That a Bishop Resident in his Church, upon any ones procuring favour by any unlawful Means towards the Absolution of a fault or offence, into which the Bishop has already begun to inquire, or by false entreaties be begg'd to remit the punishment, to which the Criminal has by him been Condemn'd, he shall briefly himself make it known, as being Delegate of the Apostolick See, and shall not admit that favour for lawfully receiv'd, which was got by telling of a Lye and concealing the Truth.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF there were that Gratitude in all towards God, as constantly to regard our Righteousness receiv'd in Baptism by his Grace and Favour, there had been no need for the instituting another Sacrament besides that of Baptism, for the Remission of Sins: But because God, who is rich in Mercy, knew what mould we were cast in, hath likewise found out a Remedy for them, who had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards given up themselves to the Servitude of Sin and power of the Devil, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sacrament of Pennance, whereby the Benefit of Christ's death is applied unto them that fall or lapse after Baptism. Repentance indeed is necessary for all men, who have defil'd themselves with any Mortal Sin, for the obtaining Grace and Righteousness at any time, even for them, who have desired to be washed in the Sacrament of Baptism, that prejudice being rejected and amended, they may detest that so heinous offence towards God with an hatred of Sin and pious Grief of Mind. Whence it is that the Prophet says, <hi>Repent, and turn from all your Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, so iniquity shall not be your Ruine.</hi> Our Lord also hath said, <hi>Unless ye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> And <hi>Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apostles, commending Repentance to Sinners that were to be initiated into Baptism, did say, <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you.</hi> Moreover, neither was Pennance a Sacrament before Christ's coming, nor is it one after his coming to any before Baptism: But our Lord did then Chiefly institute this Sacrament of Pennance, when being risen from the Dead, he breathed upon his Disciples, saying; <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose Sins ye remit they are remitted; and whose Sins ye retain they are retained.</hi> By which so signal an expression and words so clear, it was the general opinion of all the Fathers, That the Power of remitting and retaining Sins for the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of the Faithful, lapsed after Baptism, was communicated to the Apostles and their lawful Successors. The Catholick Church for great Reason hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded and condemned the <hi>Novatians</hi> as Hereticks, for so pertinaciously denying the Power of remitting Sins. Wherefore this holy Synod allowing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sense of those words of our Lord as most true, doth condemn the fictitious interpretations of such as falsely wrest those words to the power of Preaching the Word of God, and declaring the Gospel of Christ, contrary to the Institution of this Sacrament.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MOreover this Sacrament is known to differ from that of Baptism for many Reasons; for besides that the Matter and Form, whereof the Essence of a Sacrament is composed, do very much disagree; it appears plainly that the Minister of Baptism ought not to be a Judge, seeing the Church doth not Judge any, who have not first been initiated therein by Baptism. For, says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, what have I to do to judge those that are without? It is otherwise with the Houshold of Faith, whom Christ our Lord hath made members together with him of his Body through the Laver of Baptism; for such, if they shall have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards polluted themselves with any Crime, he would not have presently clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a Repetition of Baptism, it being not by any means allowed of by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, but to stand, as Guilty, before this Tribunal, that by the Sentence of Priests not only once, but as often as Penitents upon sin contracted, shall fly unto him, they may be absolved. Notwithstanding there is one Fruit of Baptism, another of Pennance; For by Baptism putting on Christ, we do therein wholly become new Creatures, obtaining a full and total Remission of all our Sins; to which we are yet no ways able to arrive, but by our Many Tears and Labours, by the Sacrament of Pennance, divine Justice requiring it of Us: as, Pennance by the Holy Fathers hath been deservedly called a <hi>Laborious kind of Baptism.</hi> And this Sacrament of Pennance is necessary to Salvation to those that have fallen after Baptism, as Baptism it self is to the Unregenerate.</p>

                     <p>THis holy Synod doth further teach, That the Form of the Sacrament of Pennance, in which its force chiefly consists, is placed in those words of the Minister; <hi>I absolve thee,</hi> &amp;c. to which indeed are laudably joyn'd some Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers according to the Custom of holy Church; but they no way respect the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Form, nor are they necessary to the Administration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Acts of the Penitent himself, as namely, Contrition, Confession and Satisfaction, are as it were the matter of this Sacrament; which Acts, seeing by God's Institution they are required in the Penitent towards the Integrity of the Sacrament, and the full and perfect Remission of Sins, they are, for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, call'd Parts of Pennance; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102311:40"/>is wont to beget Peace and Quietness of Conscience, with a very great Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Spirit. This Holy Synod delivering these things of the Parts and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this Sacrament, doth Condemn the Opinions of those, who contend, That the Parts of Pennance, are the shaken Terrors of Conscience, and Faith.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Contrition.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>COntrition, which obtains the first place among the foresaid Acts of a Penitent, is a Grief of Mind and Detestation of Sin Committed, with a Resolution to Sin no more. And this Motive of Contrition was at all times necessary for the begging Pardon for Sins; so lastly, it does prepare a man, that is faln after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, for the Remission of his Sins, if it be joyn'd with Confidence in the Divine Mercy, and with a desire of performing the other things, that are required for the rightly undertaking of this Sacrament: This holy Synod doth therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this Contrition to contain not only a cessation from Sin, and a Purpose and Beginning of a New Life, but also a Detestation of the Old, according to that saying; <hi>Cast away from you all Iniquities, wherein ye have prevaricated, and make ye a New Heart and a New Spirit:</hi> And surely they who have considered those Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of holy Persons; <hi>Against thee only have I sinned, and done this Evil in thy sight: I am weary with my groaning, every night make I my bed to swim: I will recount unto thee all my Years in the Bitterness of my Soul;</hi> and others of this kind, will easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them to have flown from some vehement hatred of their by-past Life, and great abhorrence of their Sins. It doth moreover teach, that although it happen this Contrition is sometime perfected by Charity, and reconciles a man to God, before he may actually receive this Sacrament, nevertheless this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is not to be Ascribed to Contrition it self without a desire of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is included in it. But that Imperfect Contrition, which is called Attrition, because out of the consideration of the Turpitude of the sin, or the fear of Hell and Punishment is commonly conceived, if it exclude the desire or will of sinning, and declare it with a hope of Pardon, it does not only not make a man a Hypocrite, and more a sinner, but it also is the gift of God and of the holy Spirit impulsed, not as yet indeed dwelling in him, but only moving him, wherewith the Penitent being assisted, he does prepare his way to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And although it cannot of it self without the Sacrament of Pennance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a sinner unto righteousness, yet it disposes him to beg the Grace of God in the Sacrament of Pennance: For with this Fear the <hi>Ninivites</hi> were profitably moved, and repented and begg'd mercy of God upon <hi>Jonah</hi>'s preaching, being full of threats. Wherefore some do falsely calumniate the Catholick Writers, as if they taught, That the Sacrament of Pennance, without any good motion of the Penitents, did conferr Grace; which the Church of God never taught nor thought of: But they falsely teach, That Contrition is extorted and forced, not free and voluntary.</p>

                     <p>BY the Institution of the Sacrament of Pennance already explain'd, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church hath always understood, an unreserved Confession of Sins to have been instituted also by the Lord, and to be necessary by the Divine Law to all who have lapsed after Baptism: Because our Lord Jesus Christ, being about to ascend from Earth to Heaven, left Priests the Ministers of himself, as Presidents and Judges, unto whom all mortal Crimes should be referr'd, into which the Faithful in Christ should have faln; whereby according to the power of the Keys, they may pronounce sentence of Remission or Retention of Sins: For it is plain, that Priests could not exercise this Justice, for they knew not what, nor indeed could they preserve Equity in injoyning them Pennances, if they had only <hi>in Genere,</hi> and not rather <hi>in Specie,</hi> and one by one, declared their Sins unto them. From whence we gather, That all the mortal sins of Penitents, whereof, after a diligent Examination of themselves, their Conscience does accuse them, ought to be named in Confession, let them be never so occult, and only committed against the two last Precepts of the Decalogue, which do sometimes more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously disturb the mind, and are more dangerous to Penitents, than such as are committed in publick: For Venial sins, whereby we are not excluded from the Grace of God, and into which we very often lapse, although they may rightly and profitably and without all presumption be mentioned in Confession, as the Use of Godly men doth demonstrate, yet they may be concealed without any fault, and by other Remedies Expiated. But, seeing all mortal sins, even of the thought, do render men the Sons of Wrath and Enemies of God, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that they seek pardon for them all of God, by an open and modest Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: While therefore the Faithful in Christ endeavour to confess all the sins which they remember, without doubt they expose them all to the Divine Mercy to be tried; but they that do otherwise, and wittingly retain any, do propose nothing to the Divine Goodness to be remitted by the Priest, for if a sick Person be ashamed to discover his distemper to his Physician, how should he cure that which he does not know what is? It doth moreover think fit, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances be also laid open in Confession, which change the <hi>Species</hi> of the sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without them the sins themselves are not sufficiently declared by the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, nor do they appear clear to their Judges or Confessors; and it cannot be effected, that they may be censur'd according to the grievousness of the Offences, nor the punishment, which ought, be imposed upon the Penitents: So that it is far from Reason, to teach that these Circumstances were invented by idle men, or that one circumstance is only to be confess'd, namely, To have offended a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is impious to say, that Confession is impossible which is injoyn'd to be done this way; or to call it a Carnage or torturing of Consciences: For it is plain, there is nothing more required by the Church of Penitents, than, that every one, after he hath diligently examin'd himself, and tried and search'd every
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102311:41"/>creek and corner of his Conscience, he may confess those sins, wherewith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members he has mortally offended the Lord his God; and the rest of his sins, which, after diligent examination he does not remember, are understood to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Gross in that Confession; for which we faithfully say with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>O Lord, Cleanse me from my secret Sins.</hi> But the Difficulty of this sort of Confession and the shamefac'dness of detecting their Sins might indeed seem hard, if it were not alleviated with so many and so great Advantages and Consolations, which are most certainly conferr'd upon all who come unto this Sacrament wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, by Absolution. Moreover as to the manner of Confessing privately to the Priest only, although Christ hath not forbid it, yet some may confess their sins pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in detestation of their wickedness, and for the humiliation of themselves, as well for an example to others, as to the Edification of the offended Church: Yet it is not commanded in this divine Precept, nor ought it deliberately to be enjoyn'd by any humane Law, that Sins, especially secret Sins, should be made publick by Confession: Whence, seeing by the most holy and most ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with a general and unanimous Consent, secret Sacramental Confession, which the holy Church has us'd from the beginning and does now use, has been always commended, it does manifestly refel the vain Calumny of those, who are not ashamed to teach, That it is contrary to the Divine Precept, and that it is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention, and had its original from the Fathers assembled in the Council of <hi>Lateran;</hi> for the Church did not decree or appoint by the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> That the Faithful in Christ should confess their sins, which it understood to be necessary and instituted by the Divine Law; but that the Command of Confession should be fulfill'd by all and singular, when they once come to years of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at least once in a Year: Whence it is, that that saving Custom of Confession is observed in the Catholick Church, with great benefit to the Souls of the Faithful, in that holy and acceptable time of <hi>Lent:</hi> Which Custom this holy Synod does most highly approve of and embrace, as pious and worthy to be kept.</p>

                     <p>ABout the Minister of this Sacrament, this holy Synod doth declare, All Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be false and altogether estrange from the truth of the Gospel, which do perniciously extend the Ministery of the Keys to any other Men, except to Bishops and Priests, thinking those words of our Lord, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth shall be loosed on Heaven:</hi> And, <hi>whose sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose sins ye retain they are retained,</hi> do indifferently and promiscuously belong to all Christ's faithful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Institution of this Sacrament, and were said, That every one might have the power of Remitting Sins, such as were publick indeed by Correption, if the party reprov'd did so rest; but secret ones by a spontaneous Confession made to whom the party pleased. It doth also teach, That even Priests, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some mortal sin, by virtue of the Holy Spirit received in Ordination, as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102311:41"/>Ministers of Christ to exercise the Function of Remitting Sins; and that they think depravely, who contend that this power is not in evil Priests. And although Absolution of a Priest of another Benefice be by Dispensation; yet it is not only a bare Ministery, or preaching the Gospel, or a declaring of Sins to be remitted; but as a judicial Act whereby by himself, as by a Judge, sentence is pronounced; and therefore a Penitent ought not to flatter himself up so in his own Confidence, that if he has no Contrition in himself, or the Priest has no mind seriously to act and truly to absolve; yet he may think himself, upon the account of his Faith only, truly and before god absolved; Nor indeed could Faith without Pennance, work any Remission of Sins; nor ought any one, unless most negligent of his own Salvation, when he knows the Priest absolves him but in a Jest, to forbear seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for another, who shall be more serious in the performance.</p>

                     <p>BEcause therefore Reason, and the Nature of Judgement doth require that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be only pass'd upon Subjects, it has always been the Opinion of the Church of God, and this Synod affirms it to be most true, That an Absolution ought to be of no Effect, which a Priest exercises upon him, over whom he hath not an Ordinary or subdelegate Jurisdiction: But it seem'd to our most holy Fathers to pertain very much to the Instruction of Christ's people, that some more heinous and grievous Crimes should be absolved not by every one, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Cheif of the Priests: Whence it is that Popes could deservedly, by the supreme power that is committed to them in the Universal Church, reserve the Causes of some more Grievous Crimes to their own particular Judgment. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be doubted, seeing all things that are, are ordain'd of God, but that the same is lawful to all Bishops in their Respective Dioceses, towards Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not Destruction, by reason of that Authority given to them over their Subjects beyond that of other inferiour Priests; especially as to those things, to which is annexed the Censure of Excommunication. But this Reservation of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences is consonant to the Divine Authority, not only as to the external Polity, but it has also force before God: And it has been always piously reserv'd in the said Church of God, lest any one upon that Occasion should perish, that there may be no Reservation at the point of Death; and therefore all Priests may absolve any Penitents from any Sins or Censures, beyond which point if Priests can do nothing in Reserved Cases, yet let them strive to perswade the Penitents to this, That they go to Superior and Lawful Judges for the benefit of Absolution.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>LAstly, as to Satisfaction, which proceeds from all the parts of Repentance, as it hath always been commended to Christs people by our Ancestors; so one thing in our Age, under a pretext of Piety, is very much impugned by those, who having a shew of Godliness, denying the power thereof: This Holy Synod doth declare it altogether false, and contrary to the Word of God, that a fault is never remitted by our Lord, but the whole Punishment thereof is remitted; For there are clear and pregnant examples found in Holy Writ, whereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Divine Tradition, this Error is most manifestly evinc'd; and indeed, the Reason of Divine Justice seems to require that they may be otherwise received by him into Grace; who, through Ignorance, have sinn'd before Baptism; but they after another manner, who being once freed from the servitude of Sin and Satan, and having received the Gift of the Holy Ghost, do wilfully violate the Temple of God, and are not afraid to vex the Holy Spirit; And it so beseems the Divine Clemency, lest our sins might be forgiven us without any satisfaction; as, thinking our sins lighter than they are, we, as Injurious and Reproaching the Holy Spirit, fall into greater, Treasuring up to our selves Wrath against the Day of Wrath: and without doubt, these satisfactory Punishments, do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully keep back from sin, and as it were with a Bridle restrain us, rendring Penitents, for the future, more wary and vigilant; they cure also the remainder of sins, and take away vitious courses, acquired by ill Living, with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Actions of Virtue: Nor indeed was there ever any way thought more secure in the Church of God, to prevent Gods imminent punishing us, than that men with true Grief of mind should accustom themselves to these works of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Add hereto, that while we suffer by satisfying for our sins, we are made conformable to Jesus Christ, who satisfied for our sins, and from whom is all our fullness, and also have a sure Confidence thereby, that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him: notwithstanding this satisfaction is not so far ours, which we have paid for our sins, as that it is not through Jesus Christ; for we, who of our selves are not able to do any thing as of our selves, by his working with us, who is our strength, we are able to do all things; so that man has not any thing whereof to Glory, but all our Glorying is in Christ, in whom we live, in whom we merit, in whom we make Satisfaction, bringing forth fruits meet for Repentance, which have their Virtue from him, are offer'd by him to the Father, and through him are accepted of the Father. Therefore Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters ought, as far as the Spirit, and Prudence do suggest, to enjoyn saving and convenient Satisfaction, according to the quality of Crimes, and ability of the Penitents; lest perchance they might wink at sins, and act more indulgently with Penitents, by enjoyning the lightest punishments for the most grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, they be made partakers of others sins; but let them have before their eyes, that the satisfaction they impose, be not only for the preservation of a new
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102311:42"/>Life, and healing of Infirmity, but also for the Punishment and Chastisement of past Sins; for the Keys were not only given to Priests, to loose, or to bind, as the Ancient Fathers believe and teach. Neither did they therefore think this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance to be the <hi>Forum</hi> of Wrath and Punishment, as never any Catholick did think the force of the Merit and Satisfaction of our Lord Jesus Christ was either obscured, or in any part diminished by these kinds of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ours: Which while Upstarts do understand, they so teach a new Life to be the best Pennance, that they take away all the Force and Use of Satisfaction.</p>

                     <p>THis Holy Unction, instituted for the sake of the Infirm by our Lord Jesus Christ, as a real and proper Sacrament of the New Testament, insinuated indeed to us by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and commended and published unto the Faithful by St. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, and Brother of our Lord: He says, <hi>Is any among you sick and weak; Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oil in the name of the Lord: And the Prayer of Faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will ease him; and if he lie under sins, they shall be forgiven him.</hi> From which words, as being of Apostolical Tradition, handed down to the Church, it hath Learn'd and doth teach the Matter, Form, proper Minister, and Effect of this Salutary Sacrament; for the Church has understood the Matter to be Oil blessed by the Bishop, seeing that Unction does most fitly represent the Grace of the Holy Spirit, wherewith the Soul of the Sick is invisibly Anointed: The Form begins in these words, <hi>By this Unction or Anointing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>FUrthermore, the Matter and Effect of this Sacrament is explain'd in these words; <hi>And the Prayer of Faith shall save the Sick;</hi> and <hi>the Lord shall ease him, and if he lie under Sins, they shall be forgiven him:</hi> For the Matter is this Grace of the Holy Ghost, whose Anointing wipes away Sins, if any yet remain not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as also the Relicks thereof, and comforts and strengthens the Soul of the Sick, exciting in him a strong confidence of the Divine Mercy: Whereby the Sick gets ease, and does better bear the inconveniences and pangs of his Disease, and does more easily resist the Temptations of the Devil, that assaults him tooth and nail, and sometimes does recover his health of Body, if the Lord see it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, for the Health of his Soul.</p>

                     <p>AND now, as to what belongs to the Prescription or Appointment of such, as ought both to Receive and Administer this Sacrament, is also not obscurely deliver'd in those words aforesaid; For it is there shown, that the proper Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102311:43"/>of this Sacrament are the Elders of the Church; in whose name or in whose stead may not be understood to come the Elders or Chief among the People, but either Bishops, or Priests being Presbyters rightly ordain'd by them with the Imposition of Hands. It does also declare, That this Unction is to be apply'd to the Sick, but more especially to those, who lie so dangerously ill, that they may be thought at the end of their Life, whence it is call'd the Sacrament of Souls Departing. But if the Sick, after having receiv'd this Unction, grow well again, they may a second time be helped by this Sacrament, when they fall into the like danger of Life again: Wherefore, by no means ought they to be heard, who, against so plain and clear an opinion of St. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, teach, That this Unction is of humane Invention, or a Ceremony taken up by the Fathers, having neither command of God, nor promise of Grace for it; Nor they who say that it is now ceased, as if it were only to be referr'd to the Primitive Church for the Grace of working Cures: Nor they who say that the Rite and Custom, which the Holy <hi>Romish</hi> Church observes, is contrary to the opinion of St. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, and therefore ought to be changed into another: Nor, lastly, they, who affirm, That this Extream Unction may be Contemned without Sin in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; For these do almost manifestly thwart the plain Words of the Apostle. Nor indeed does the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Mother and Mistress of all others, observe ought in the administration of this Unction, as to those things which make up the Substance of this Sacrament, but what the blessed St. <hi>James</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. Nor can there be such a Contempt of so great a Sacrament without great impiety, and Injuring of the Holy Ghost himself.</p>
                     <p>These are the Doctrines about the Sacraments of Pennance and Extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which this Holy Oecumenick Council professeth and teacheth, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to all the Faithful in Christ to believe and hold: And does deliver the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Canons to be Inviolably kept, condemning and cursing to Eternity those that affirm the contrary.</p>

                  <p>SEeing it was for this reason a Decree was made in the foregoing Sessions, the holy and universal Synod having on these days most diligently and accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled those things which pertain to the most holy Sacrifice of the Mass and to the Sacrament of Order, that in the Session on this day, even as the holy Spirit had suggested, Decrees of these matters, and of four Articles besides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, which were put off till this very Session, should be made publick; thinking in the mean time that those who call themselves <hi>Protestants</hi> would be present in this most holy Council; for whose sakes the publication of those Articles was deferr'd; and that they might come hither freely, and without any doubting, hath granted them the Publick Faith, or Safe Conduct: Nevertheless, seeing they are not as yet come, and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been made to this Synod in their Name, That the Publication, which ought to have been made on this day, might be deferr'd till the next Session, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good hopes, that they will be all together present long before the said Session, having in the interim receiv'd Safe Conduct in more ample form; The aforesaid Holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Spirit of Holiness, the said Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and Nuncio's presiding therein, desiring nothing more, than to take away all Divisions and Schisms in Religion in the most famous <hi>German</hi> Nation, and to provide for the Peace and Quietness thereof, being ready, if they come, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with humanity, and hear them mildly, and trusting that they will come with a desire to search out the truth, and not pertinaciously to resist the Catholick Faith; and that, as becomes those that are desirous of Gospel-truth, at last to acquiesce in the Decrees and Discipline of our holy mother the Church, hath put off the next Session, for the divulging and publishing of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, till the Feast of St. <hi>Joseph,</hi> which will be the 19th of the month of <hi>March,</hi> that they may have time enough, not only to come, but also to propose what they have a mind before the day come. To whom, that all cause of further Delay may be utterly taken away, it doth freely give and grant the Publick Faith and Safe Conduct in the Tenour and Form following. But in the Interim it doth appoint and determine to treat in this Session of the Sacrament of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and a definition to be made thereof, over and above the publication of the fore-cited Decrees, and the business of Reformation to be Prosecuted.</p>

                  <p>THE thrice holy, Oecumenick and General Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Spirit of Holyness, the most Reverend Lords, <hi>Sebastian,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Sipont,</hi> and <hi>Aloysius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Verona,</hi> Apostolick Nuncio's presiding therein, as well in their own name, as that of the most Reverend and most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Lord <hi>Marcellus,</hi> by the Title of S. <hi>Marcellus</hi> Cardinal of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Legate of <hi>Creseon,</hi> absent by reason of his great Indisposition, does not doubt, but that every Christian knows, that this Oecumenick Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was first call'd happily and gather'd together by <hi>Paul</hi> III. afterwards by our most holy Lord <hi>Julius</hi> III. at the request of the most August Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. for this cause principally recall'd, that it might re-establish Religion in its pristine State, divided into divers Opinions in many parts of the World, especially in <hi>Germany,</hi> and amend Abuses and the most corrupt manners of Christians; And seeing very many Fathers for this end, without any respect had to their pains or danger, had chearfully flock'd hither from divers Countries, that the matter might, with a great concourse of People, be strenuously and faithfully carried on; and there was no small hope, that those of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, who had raised up these Novelties, would come to the Council; hoping also that they would unanimously acquiesce in the true Reasons of the Church: Lastly, Heaven seem'd to favour our Undertakings, and the Christian Commonwealth that before was forlorn and afflicted, began to lift up its head; when those Tumults on a sudden, and those Wars, by the cunning craftiness of the Devil broke out, so that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, sufficiently to its disadvantage, was forced to hesitate and put a stop to its procedures, and all hopes of farther progress was now taken away; and the holy Synod was thereby so far from healing the Evils and Differences among Christians, that it irritated rather than appeased the minds of many, contrary to the expectation thereof: When therefore this holy Synod saw all places, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Germany,</hi> to be embroil'd in Arms and Discords, almost all the <hi>German</hi> Bishops, especially the Electoral Princes, left the Council to consult the Good of their Churches; It decreed that such a Necessity was not to be striven with, but that it should be hush'd till better times; That the Fathers, who were not at that time able to act, might return to their Respective Churches to take care of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102311:55"/>their Flocks, that they may not spend their time at both places to no purpose. And therefore, the condition of the Times so requiring it, it does Determine, the progress of this Oecumenick Council of <hi>Trent</hi> shall be suspended for two Years, as by this present Decree it doth suspend it; but with this Proviso, That, if the Difference be composed sooner, and our pristine Quietness be returned, which it hopes will not be long, through the Blessing of the great and good God, then from the very time the Council may be deem'd to have its full force, strength and vigour as before: But if (which God forbid) the foresaid lawful Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the end of two years, shall not be removed, as soon as ever they shall cease, such suspension may be understood <hi>eo ipso</hi> to be void, and its strength and vigor restor'd to the Council, and may be understood to be without a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation thereof, the Consent and Authority of his Holiness and of the Apostolick See being had in this Decree.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the said Holy Synod doth Exhort all Christian Princes, and all Prelates, to observe, and respectively to cause to be observed, by all that are under their Jurisdictions, in their Kingdoms, Dominions, and Churches, all and singular the things, that have been hitherto appointed and decreed by this Holy Oecumenick Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

               <p>BEing called to the Government of the Church by the alone vouchsafement of Allmighty God, although unfit for so great a Charge, imediately considering intently all the parts of the Christian Common-wealth; and perceiving, not without a great Horror, how long and how far the pest of Heresies and Schism had got footing, and what great need the manners of Christian People were in of Correction or Amendment, we begun, according to our place, upon that care and consideration, to endeavour the Extirpation of those Heresies, and the taking away of so great and so pernicious a Schism, and amendment of Manners so much corrupted and depraved. But understanding, that the fittest remedy for the cure of these Evils, and which this holy See has been wont to administer, was that of a General Oecumenick Council; we have taken Advice for the Congregating and Celebrating of one, with Gods Assistance. It was indeed formerly call'd by the late happy <hi>Paul</hi> III. and by his Successor <hi>Julius,</hi> our Predecessors, but for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reasons being often hindred and interrupted, it could not effectually be brought about. For <hi>Paul,</hi> having first appointed the Celebration of the said. Council in the City of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Vincentia;</hi> for some Reasons express'd in his Letters, he first suspends, and then transfers the Council to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102311:55"/>
                  <hi>Trent.</hi> Here also the Time of its Celebration is delayed and put off upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular accounts; when at last, all Suspensions and other Impediments laid aside, it was begun in the said City of <hi>Trent.</hi> But after some Sessions holden and some Decrees made, the said Council was afterwards for some Causes, together with the concurrent Authority of the See Apostolical, transferred to <hi>Bulleign.</hi> But <hi>Julius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Paul,</hi> recalls the same in the said City of <hi>Trent:</hi> At which time some other Decrees are also made. And now some Stirs and Commotions arising in the neighbouring Places of <hi>Germany,</hi> and a direfull War raging in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Council is again suspended, and put off; the Enemy of Mankind then setting all his Engines at Work, by throwing all the difficulties and Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he could in the way, to delay and retard at least the Good and Welfare of the Church as long as he could, since it was not in his power to take it away or totally subvert it. In the mean time Heresies exceedingly increased, multiplied and propagated; the Schism grew wider and wider; which to remember as it raises our Sorrow, so to relate auguments our Grief. But at length, the good and merciful God, who is never so angry, as to forget Mercy; vouchsafed to give peace and unity to Christian Kings and Princes. Which opportunity thus offered to us, We hope the said Mercy will be readily embraced, that so by the means of a Council an end may be put to these so great and growing Evils of the Church. We therefore have thought fit, to the end the said Schism and Heresies may be taken away, Manners amended and reformed, and Peace among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes preserved, that the Celebration of the said Council be no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. Wherefore upon mature Advice and Deliberation had with the Reverend our Brethren, the Cardinals of the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having acquainted our most dear Sons in Christ, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Elect Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Kings and Princes with this our Counsel, whom we have indeed found, as in their great Piety and Wisdom they promised, ready to advance and help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the celebration of the said Council: We do, to the praise, honour and glory of Almighty God, and the good of the Church universal, by and with the advice and consent of our said Brethren, summon and appoint an Holy, Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick, and General Council, by authority of the same God, and the blessed Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which authority we also are invested with and enjoy upon Earth; to be holden in the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> upon the most holy Festival of the Resurrection of our Lord now next ensuing, and the same then and there to be celebrated, we do ordain and appoint, without any suspension whatsoever. Wherefore we do earnestly admonish and exhort in the Lord, as also strictly charge and command the Reverend our Brethren, from all places, Patriarchs, Arch-bishops, and our beloved Sons the Abbots, and all and singular other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons, who may or ought by any common Right, Priviledge, or anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Custome to sit and give sentence in a General Council, that by virtue of Holy Obedience, and in regard also of the Oath they have taken, and under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties which they know are made and constituted in the Holy Canons for those who shall neglect to come to General Councils, they do convene and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at or upon the day appointed to celebrate the said Council; except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they be hindred by any lawful Lett or Impediment; which said Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment, they shall and ought to attest by lawful Procurators in the Synod.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102311:56"/>Furthermore We admonish all and singular person or persons, whom it doth or may concern, that they fail not to be present at the said Council. But we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and pray our most dear Sons in Christ, the Elect Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the other Kings and Princes, whom it were heartily to be wisht could be present in the Council, that, if they cannot be personally present there them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they send prudent, grave, and pious men their Orators, who may be there present in their name and behalf; as also that they will take a diligent care, that their Prelates, when out of their respective Kingdoms and Dominions, do perform their Duty to God and the Church, without any denyal and delay, at a time so convenient and fit: Not doubting but that they will also provide, that a safe and free passage through their respective Kingdoms and Dominions be allowed to Prelates, and their Servants and Retinue, and to all other persons going to, or returning from the said Council; and that they be received and treated in all places courteously and benignly; as we our selves will also take care, in what appertains to us; who have purposed not to omit any thing which can by us be done, for the effecting so pious and wholsome a Work: Desiring nothing else, God knoweth, nor having any other purpose or intent in celebrating this Council, but the Honour of God, the bringing back the Sheep dispersed and gone astray, and the Welfare and perpetual Peace and Tranquillity of Christendom. To the end then that these Letters, and what things soever are therein contained, may, as they ought, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every one; that none may pretend Ignorance of the same, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or pretext: especially because a safe Passage may not perhaps be free unto all those, whom it behoveth to be certified of these Letters: We will and command, that they be rehearsed openly with a loud Voice by the Courrier of our Court, or some of our publick Notaries, in the Royal <hi>Vatican</hi> of the Prince of the Apostles, and in the Lateran Church, at the same time that the people are wont there to assemble and meet together, to be present at the Solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mass; and after they shall have been so read, they shall and may be affixed to the Doors of the said Churches, as also to the Apostolick Chancery, and in the accustomed place in the Field of <hi>Flora,</hi> and there be left for some time, to be read, and made known to all persons: but upon removal and taking away the same, Copies thereof shall after continue affixed to the said places. For our Will is, that by this Recitation, Publication and Affixing, all and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular the persons, who are comprehended and concluded in these our Letters, after two months next ensuing the publication and affixing of the same, be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth obliged and bounden, as if the said Letters had been set forth and read in their presence. And further we appoint and command, that whatever Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tication there be taken of these Letters, they shall be strengthened under the hand-writing of some Notary Publick, or his Subscription, or under the Seal and Subscription of some dignified person of the Church, that credit may be thereto given without scruple or doubtfulness. Wherefore it may and shall be lawful for no person whatsoever, to infringe the contents of this our Indiction, Statute, Decree, Precept, Admonition, and Exhortation; or rashly dare to go contrary to the same. But if any shall presume to attempt so to do, be it known to him he will thereby incur the Anger of Almighty God, and of his

                  <head>A Decree for the Choice of Books, and for publick Freedom and Safety to those who were to be invited to the Council.</head>
                  <p>THe most Holy, Oecumenick, and General Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assembled in the Spirit of Holiness, the said Legates of the Apostolick See presiding therein, not trusting in any humane power and strength, but relying on the aid and assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath promised he will give a Mouth and Wisdom to his Church, doth chiefly and especially design, that it may hereafter restore the Doctrine of the Catholick Faith, corrupted and obscured in many places, by the Opinions of many disagreeing between themselves, unto its Purity and Splendor; and that it may bring back again the Customs and Manners, which have deflected from their Ancient Institution, unto a better method of Life; and to turn the <hi>heart of the Fathers unto the Children, and the heart of the Children unto the Fathers:</hi> Whereas therefore this Council first of all considers, that at this time the number of suspected and pernicious Books, wherein impure Doctrines are contained, and scattered abroad far and wide, have too much increased and abounded; for which reason, many Censures in divers Provinces, and especially in the Holy City of <hi>Rome,</hi> have with a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal been set forth and published; and yet no wholsome Medicine could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy so great and destructive a Disease: It hath thought good, that the Fathers, chosen for this Disquisition concerning Censures and Books, should seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and weigh, what is needful to be done in this case, as also to make their Report thereon in their own time to the said Holy Synod, to the end it may the more easily separate the various and strange Doctrines, as Tares from the Corn of Christian Truth; and more advantageously to deliberate and appoint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these matters, what shall seem more opportune and fit for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all scruples out of the minds of many, and the taking away of sundry Complaints. But all these things the Synod willeth be brought to the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Particulars, as also by this present Decree it declareth: To the end that if any person shall think himself any ways concern'd herein, either in this business of Books and Censures, or in any other matter or thing, which are to be handled in this General Council; he doubt not but to be patiently and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously heard by the Holy Synod.</p>
                  <p>And because the said holy Synod most heartily wisheth, and earnestly beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, for those things which conduce to the Peace of the Church, that all of us acknowledging one Common Mother upon Earth, who cannot forget those she brought forth, <hi>may with one Mind and one Mouth glorifie God and the Father of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102311:57"/>our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> It invites and exhorts, by the <hi>Bowels of Mercy</hi> of the same God and our Lord, all those, who hold not Communion with us, to come to a Concord and Reconciliation, as also to this Holy Synod; and to embrace Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is the <hi>Bond of Perfectness;</hi> and to have the Peace of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they are called, rejoycing in their hearts, in one Body. Let them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hearing the Voice, not of Man, but of the Holy Ghost, harden their hearts; but, not walking after their own Senses, nor pleasing themselves, let them be excited and converted to the so holy and wholsome Admonition of their Mother; For as the holy Synod inviteth them, so will it embrace them with all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Charity and Love.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the said Holy Synod hath decreed, that publick Freedom and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be granted in the general Assembly, and the same to have the same force, and to be in as full strength and virtue, as if it had been given and decreed in a Publick Session.</p>

                  <p>THe most holy, Oecumenick, and General Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> lawfully assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Spirit of Holiness, the said Legates of the Apostolical See presiding therein, (seeing divers monstrous Errors in several places, concerning the tremendous and most holy Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> are carried up and down by the wicked arts of the Devil, by reason of which many in some Provinces do seem to depart from the Faith and obedience of the Catholick Church) hath thought good that These be in this place expounded and declared, which appertain to the Communion in Both kinds, and of young Children. Wherefore it interdicts all the faithful servants of Christ, that they do not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after dare to Believe, Teach or Preach otherwise of these things, than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and defined in these ensuing Decrees.</p>

                     <p>THerefore the said holy Synod taught by the holy Spirit, which is the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Fear of God, and following the judgment and custom of the said Catholick Church, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and teach; That Laymen, and those not made Clerks, are by no divine command obliged to take the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in both kinds, nor can <hi>(Salvà fide)</hi> be doubted, but that their communicating in one kind is sufficient to Salvation. For although the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> did institute in his last Supper this venerable Sacrament under the kinds of Bread and Wine, and so gave it to his Apostles, yet such Institution and Tradition do not infer, that all Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are by Gods Ordinance obliged to take it in both kinds. Nor is it rightly gather'd from that saying in the Sixth of <hi>John,</hi> that the Communion in both kinds was commanded by Christ; however it may be understood according to the various Interpretations of the holy Fathers and Doctors. For he that said, <hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102311:60"/>in you;</hi> said also, <hi>He that eateth of this Bread, shall live for ever.</hi> And he that said, <hi>Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life;</hi> said also, <hi>The Bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And lastly he that said, <hi>He that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me and I in him;</hi> said nevertheless, <hi>He that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever.</hi>

And this the Apostle seems plainly to intimate, when he says; <hi>Let a Man so esteem of us, as the Ministers of Christ, and Dispensers of the Mysteries of God.</hi> And that he did indeed use this Power is sufficiently manifest, as in many other things, so in this very Sacrament; when, after having ordained some things about the use of it, he says, <hi>The rest I will set in order when I come.</hi> Wherefore our holy mother the Church taking upon it this its Authority in Administration of Sacraments, though from the Rise of the Christian Religion the use of both kinds was often held and observed; yet process of Time having changed the said custom, induced upon weighty and just Causes, hath allowed and approved of this usage of communicating in one kind, and hath decreed it be held as a Law, which is in the power of none to reject, or without the authority of the said Church to alter or change.</p>

                     <p>LAstly, the said Holy Synod teacheth, That Young Children, wanting the use of Reason, are not by any necessity obliged to the Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Eucharist; for being regenerated by the washing of Baptism, and incorporated into Christ, they cannot lose in that Age the received Grace of the Children of God. Nevertheless Antiquity is not to be condemned, if in some places it has still preserved the same Custom. For as the most Holy Fathers had a probable reason for their so doing, considering the state of that time; so must we certainly and without controversie believe, that they did so by no Necessity of Salvation.</p>

                     <p>BEcause under the Old Testament, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of the Levitical Priesthood, there was no Perfection or Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was necessary, God the Father of Mercies so odering it, that another Priest should arise after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> even our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who might be able to consummate and bring to perfection all, who had a mind to be Sanctified. The same God therefore, and our Lord; although he once offer'd himself to God the Father upon the Altar of the Cross, interceeding by his Death, that he might thereon work an Eternal Redemption: Yet, because, by his Death, his Priesthood was not Extinct, in his last Supper, which he gave at Night, that he might leave a visible Sacrifice to his beloved Spouse the Church, as the nature of Man requires, in which that Bloody one once acted upon the Cross might be represented, and his memory be Establish'd, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the World, and the saving Virtue thereof be applyed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of such Sins as are of daily Commission with us; declaring himself to be constituted a Priest for ever, after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> he offer'd up his Body and Blood to God the Father, under the Species of Bread and Wine, and under the Symbols of the said things deliver'd them to the Apostles, that they might take, eat, and whom he did then make Priests of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and commands them and their Successors in the Ministry, that they should offer in these words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> as Holy Church hath always Understood and Taught; for having celebrated the ancient Pass-over which the multitude of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did offer, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102311:64"/>of their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he instituted a new one, <hi>(viz.)</hi> himself to be offerred up by the Priests in the Church under visible Signs, in memory of his passing out of this World to the Father, when he redeem'd us by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of his Blood, and snatch'd us from the Power of Darkness unto his Kingdom. And this indeed is that pure Oblation, which can by no indignity or malice of such as offer, be tainted, which the Lord foretold by the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> should be purely offered in every place to his Name, which should be great among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and which the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> has not obscurely hinted, writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he says, <hi>They cannot partake of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord, who have been polluted by partaking of the Table of Devils:</hi> By <hi>Table</hi> understanding <hi>Altar</hi> in both places. This then is that which was figured to us by various Types of Sacrifices in the time of the Law and Nature; namely that, which, as the Consummation and Perfection of them all, does comprehend all the Goods by them signified.</p>

                     <p>AND because in this divine Sacrifice, which is handled in the <hi>Mass,</hi> the very same <hi>Christ</hi> is contain'd and sacrific'd without Bloodshed, who once offer'd himself up a Bloody Death upon the Altar of the Cross, This holy Synod doth Teach, That that Sacrifice is really propitiatory, and by means thereof, if we, being humbled and penitent, come unto God with a true Heart, a right Faith, with Fear and Reverence, we shall obtain Mercy and find Favour in him seasonably helping. Because by the Oblation thereof, the appeased God granting Grace and the Gift of Pennance, does remit Crimes, nay, even grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sins; for 'tis one and the same Host and Oblation, the same person now offering himself in the Ministry of the Priests, that did then offer himself up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, the manner of the Offering being only different: The Fruits of which Bloody Oblation are indeed received most plentifully through this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody one; but far be it from any one, by any means to derogate from him hereby. Wherefore this Oblation is rightly made, according to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles, not only for the Sins, Punishments, Satisfactions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Necessities of the Faithful yet a live, but also for the Dead in <hi>Christ,</hi> who are not yet throughly cleansed.</p>

                     <p>AND although the Church has been accustom'd now and then to Celebrate some Masses to the Honour and Memory of Saints; yet it does not teach that Sacrifice ought to be offer'd to them, but to God only, who Crown'd them: Whence it is, that the Priest does not say, <hi>I offer Sacrifice unto thee</hi> Peter, or, <hi>thee</hi> Paul; but giving thanks to God for their Victories, implores their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, that they would vouchsafe to intercede for us in Heaven, whom we do commemorate here on Earth.</p>

Ceremonies also she used, as mystical Benedictions, Lights, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, Vestments, and many more of that kind, of Apostolical Institution and Tradition; whereby both the majesty of such Sacrifice might be commended, and also the minds of the Faithful might be excited to contemplation of the most Holy things, which were hid in this Sacrifice, by these visible signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Piety.</p>

Provided also those Masses ought to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed common; partly, because in them the People spiritually Communicate; partly also, because they may be Celebrated by the Publick Ministry of the Church, not only for themselves, but for all the Faithful that belong to the Body of Christ.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102311:65"/>issued out of his side with the Blood; and seeing also the People were stiled Waters in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> that the union of the Faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be represented with the Head, Christ.</p>

                     <p>ALthough the Mass contain a large Instruction of a faithful People, yet the Fathers think it not convenient to be exercised publickly in the Vulgar Tongue. Wherefore the Antient approved Rite being retained every where, of every Church, even from the Holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mother and Mistress of All Churches, the Sheep of Christ shall never hunger, nor the young ones ask Bread and there shall be none to break it to them.

                  </head>
                  <p>HOW great a care is to be used, that the holy Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass</hi> be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with all Adoration, and Veneration of Religion, any one may easily imagine, who considereth that he is <hi>called Accursed in holy Writ, that doth the Work of God negligently.</hi> And if we necessarily confess, that no other work so Holy and Divine, can be done by the Faithful of <hi>Christ,</hi> as this tremendous mystery, in which that enlivening Host, in which we are reconciled to God the Father, is daily offer'd upon the Altar by the Priest, it is also manifestly evident, that all industry and diligence is therein to be used; to the end that it may be performed with as great internal Cleanness, and Purity, and external De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Piety as it can. Seeing then many things seem to be crept in already, whether by the vice of the Times, or by the carelesness and dishonesty of Men, which are contrary to the dignity of such a Sacrifice, to the end that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Worship due unto him, may be restored, to the glory of God, and the Edification of his Faithful People, the holy Council determineth, That the ordinary Bishops of Places, take all care to prohibit, and be obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102311:66"/>those things, which Superstition, the false Imitatress of true Piety, hath introduced, or Covetousness, or Servitude of Idols, or Irreverence which can hardly be separated from Impiety. And, that many Conditions may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a few, in special, they, as touching Covetousness, altogether prohibit all conditions of Wages of what kind soever; and whatsoever is given for the Celebrating of New <hi>Masses,</hi> and also unreasonable and unlawful Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rather than demands of Almes, and other things of like sort, which differ not much from a Symoniacal blot, or really from filthy Lucre. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That irreverence may be shunned, that every one in their respective Diocess, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any Vagrant and unknown Priest to Celebrate <hi>Mass. Thirdly,</hi> That they allow none, who is a notorious Criminal, to Minister at the holy Altar, or be present at holy Things, nor suffer them in private Houses, and wholly out of holy Church, and Oratories dedicated to so holy a Worship, to be ordained and visited by the same Ordinaries, in this holy Sacrifice to be performed, by any Seculars or Regulars whatsoever, unless they who are present, declare by an habit of Body, decently composed, that they are present, not only with Body but also with a Mind, and devout Affection of the Heart. Also, that they expel from their Churches, those Musicks, where any thing Lascivious or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious is mixed, whether by Organ or by Singing; and also all secular Actions, Vain, and also Prophane Discourses, Walkings, Noises, Clamours, <hi>that the House of God may truely seem the House of Prayer, and may be so called. Lastly,</hi> Let them be bound by the Edict and Pennance provided, that no place be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Superstition, nor the Priests celebrate at any other but due hours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, those that are allowed of the Church, and have been received by frequent and laudable use; nor use any Rites, or any Ceremonies, or Prayers in the celebration of the <hi>Mass;</hi> and also to take away the certain number of certain <hi>Masses,</hi> and Candles, which rather was invented by a Superstitious Worship, than by true Religion: And teach the people what this so precious and celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fruit of this holy Sacrifice is, and from whom it must come. Let them admonish the same people that they frequently come to the Parish Church, at least on the Lords Days, and the more noted Feasts. All these therefore which in brief are set down, are so propounded to all Ordinaries of Places, and not only these themselves, but all others besides, which seem to appertain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that they, even by the power given them by the holy Synod, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates of the Apostolick See, may Forbid, Command, Correct, Appoint, and compel the Faithful People, to keep these inviolate by the Censures of the Church, and other Penalties, which they at pleasure may appoint; Privileges, Exemptions, Appellations, and Customs whatsoever, notwithstanding.</p>

                     <p>THere is nothing, that may daily instigate others more to Piety, and the Worship of God, than the Life and Examples of those who dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the holy Ministry; for when they are removed from secular Affairs into an higher place they are observed, and others look upon them as in a Glass, and take that from them that they may imitate. Wherefore, it is always so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, that the Clergy called to the Lot of the Lord, compose their Life and all their Manners, that they carry nothing in Habit, Gesture, Walking, Speech, before them, but what is Grave, Moderate, and full of Religion, that they may avoid the light miscarriages which are more especially in them, that their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bring veneration to all, seeing thereby how much more these are both for the Profit and Ornament in the Church of God, so are also more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be observed. The holy Synod hath appointed, That these things that otherwise by the Chief Priests and Holy Councils, concerning the Life of the Clergy, Honesty, Worship and Doctrine be retained; and also Luxury, Banquets, Dances, Dice, Sports and any Crime whatsoever, and also secular Businesses carefully to be avoided; and wholesomly established, that the same for the time to come be observed by the same Penalties or greater to be inflicted at the pleasure of the Ordinary. Neither doth an Appeal suspend this Execution, which belongeth to the correction of Manners. And if by any means they shall find that they depart from them by disuse, as soon as they shall be brought into use, that they endeavour that they accurately be observed by all, all instances whatsoever notwithstanding, least they themselves suffer condign Punishment from God for the neglect of amending of those that are under their Charge.</p>

                  <p>MOreover, whereas the same holy Synod at the same Session, had reserved two Articles to be propounded at another time, and then to be Discussed, Examined and Determined, not then having opportunity; namely, Whether the reasons whereby the holy Church was moved, that it should Communicate the Laity, and also those Priests that do not celebrate, under one Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread, should be so retained; That the use of the <hi>Cup,</hi> by no means is to be permitted to any one: And whether the use of the <hi>Cup,</hi> if for reasons Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and Consentaneous to Christian Charity, may be granted to any, whether Nation or Kingdom, upon what conditions it may be granted, and what they are. Now willing a Decree for the best safety of those for whom it is required, it hath determined, That the whole business be referred to our most holy Lord, according as it relates to the present Decree, who thorow his singular Prudence may bring to pass that which he judgeth most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Christian Commonwealth, and to recommend the usefulness of the <hi>Cup</hi> to those that desire it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Concerning the Ordination of the Priesthood of the</hi> New-Law.</head>
                     <p>THE Sacrifice and Priesthood is so joined together, as both is extant in every Law. Seeing then in the New Testament, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church hath received the holy visible Sacrifice of the Eucharist, by the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102311:69"/>of the Lord; it ought to be confessed also, that the new and external Priesthood is visible, into which the old is Translated. And this also was granted by the same Lord our Saviour, and that Power was given to the Apostles, and their Successors in the Priests Office, of Consecrating, Offering and Administring this Body and Blood; the holy Scriptures shew it, and the Tradition of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church always taught it.</p>

                     <p>SEeing also the Ministry of so holy a Priesthood is so divine a thing, it is convenient, whereby it may be more worthily and with greater veneration exercised, that in the most orderly Disposition of the Church, there might be more and different Orders of Ministers, which might serve in the Priesthood and Office, so disposed, that they might ascend from lesser to greater, who were marked already with the Clerical Polling. For the holy Scriptures do not only distinguish plainly concerning Priests but Deacons also; and those things which more especially are to be allowed in their Ordination, That they teach in most grave words; and the names of the following Orders from the very beginning of the Church, and the proper Service of every of them, namely, of a Sub-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, Servitors, those that attend on the Eucharist, Lecturers, and Door-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were known to be in use. For the place of Sub-Deacons is brought to higher Orders, by the Fathers and holy Councils, in which we frequently read of others more Inferior.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                     <p>SEeing it is perspicuous, by the testimony of the Scripture, Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the unanimous consent of the Fathers, that Grace is conferred by holy Ordination, which is performed by Words and external Signs; none ought to doubt but that that Order is truly and properly one of the Seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the holy Church: For the Apostle saith, I admonish thee to stir up that Grace of God that is in thee by the imposition of my Hands, for God hath not given the Spirit of Fear, but Vertue, Love and Sobriety.</p>

                     <p>AND because in the Sacrament of Order, as in Baptism and Confirmation, an impression is made, which neither can be blotted out nor taken away; the holy Synod deservedly doth condemn their Opinion, who affirm that the Priests of the New Testament have but a Temporary Power only, and that once being ordained, may be made Lay-Men, if they exercise not the Ministry of the Word of God. But if any one shall affirm, That all Christians promiscuously of the New Testament are Priests, or all are endued with equal power among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; this seemeth to do nothing else, than confound the Ecclesiastical Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, which is ordained as a strong defence thereof; as though against the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> all were Apostles, all Prophets, all Evangelists, all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102311:69"/>all Doctors. Furthermore the holy Synod declareth, That besides the other Ecclesiastical Degrees, Bishops, who have succeeded in the places of the Apostles, do chiefly belong to this Hierarchical Order, and are placed, as the same Apostle saith, by the Holy Ghost, to govern the Church of God, and them to be above the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and to confer the Sacrament of Confirmation, and ordain Ministers to the Church; and that they have power to perform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, the power of which the rest of the Inferior Order have not. The holy Synod, moreover in the Ordination of the Bishops, Priests, and of the other Orders, teacheth, That neither the Consent, Vocation, or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, nor any Secular Power, or of Magistracy, be so required, as that the Ordination be without this of no effect; but rather determineth, That those, who being called and Instituted only by a People, or Secular Power, or Magistrate, do aspire to the exercising those Offices, and who presume to take them by their own rashness, are not to be accounted Ministers of the Church, but Thieves and Robbers, not entring in by the door. These are the things, which in general, the holy Synod thinks fit to teach the Faithful, concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Order. Moreover it hath determined to condemn the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to these by certain, and in proper <hi>Canons</hi> which follow, in this wise, to the end, that all, by Christs help, using the rule of Faith, may more easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and may keep the <hi>Catholick</hi> Truth in such a Darkness of Errors.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>SEeing it is commanded by divine precept to all to whom the care of Souls is committed, to know their Sheep, Offer Sacrifice for them, and by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Word and Administration of the Sacraments, and by the example of all good Works to feed them, to exercise a paternal care over the Poor, and other miserable persons, and to mind other Pastoral Offices; all which cannot by them be performed and fulfilled, who do not watch over their Flock nor assist, but forsake them after the custom of Hirelings; The holy Synod admonisheth and exhorteth them, to be mindful of divine precepts, and becoming an example to their Flock, they may feed them and govern them in Judgment and Truth. And let not these things, which, concerning residence, have been holily and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably already established, under the late happy <hi>Paul</hi> III. be alienated into other Senses, contrary to the mind of the holy Synod, as if it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the force of that Decree, to be wanting Five Months altogether; the holy Synod declareth, That all Governors in Patriarchal, Primatical, Metropolitan, and Cathedral Churches whatsoever, by what name or title so ever, although Cardinals of the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be obliged to a personal residence in their Church or Diocess, where they are to execute their injoined
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102311:70"/>Office, neither be able to be wanting unless for the beneath mentioned causes, and reasons. For when Christian Charity, urgent Necessity, due Obedience, and evident Advantage to the Church and Commonwealth, shall require and compel some sometimes; the Holy Synod determineth, That these causes of lawful Absence, either by the Metropolitan, or, he being absent, by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan Bishop of longer residence, and who shall allow the absence of the Metropolitan, be approved of in writing, unless when absence happeneth by reason of some imploy, or Office in the publick which is joined to that of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; because the causes thereof are remarkable, and sometimes sudden, it will not be needful to signifie them to the Metropolitan; yet it belongs to them with the Provincial Council, to judge concerning Licences granted by themselves or Suffragan, and see that none be abused by that Law, and that those that go astray may be punished by Canonical Punishments. In the mean time let those that are about to depart, remember to provide for their Sheep, that as much as may be, they may suffer no damage by their absence. But because they who are but a little absent, according to the Opinion of the ancient <hi>Canons,</hi> may not seem to be wanting, because they are about to return presently; The holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod will, That that space of absence every year, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> most three Months, and a reason to be given, that that be done for a just cause, and without any detriment to the Flock: Which whether it be so, it leaveth to the Conscience of those that be absent, which it hopeth will be Religious and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, seeing hearts are known unto God, whose work they are bound not to do negligently, at their own Peril. The same, in the mean time it admonisheth and exhorteth in the Lord, That for the space of the <hi>Dominical Advent, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragesima,</hi> the Nativity and Resurrection of the Lord, and also <hi>Pentecost</hi> and days of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> wherein the Sheep ought to be greatly refreshed, and rejoyced by the presence of the Pastor in the Lord, they by any means be not absent from the Cathedral Church, unless their Episcopal Office in their Diocess call them otherwise.</p>
                     <p>But if any, which it wisheth may never happen, shall be absent contrary to the intention of this Decree, the holy Synod doth appoint, besides other penalties against Non-Residents, under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third imposed and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the guilt of mortal Sin, which he incurreth, that he for a set time of absence, reap not his own Fruits, nor with a safe Conscience, think he is able to detain them for himself, but either to be detained from him neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, by an Ecclesiastical Superior, for the building of Churches, or to be employed for the poor of the place; any convenience whatsoever being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, or composition which might be pretended for ill gotten Fruits, by which the foresaid Fruits might in whole or in part be remitted to him; Privileges whatsoever granted to any College, or Building notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The same, always, as touching the Fault, Loss of Fruits, and Punishments of Inferior Curates, and any other whatsover, who, any Benefice Ecclesiastical doth obtain, having cure of Souls, the holy Synod declareth and decreeth; but so, That whensoever they, the cause being first known and allowed of by the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102311:71"/>Bishop, happen to be wanting, a fit Vicar by the same Ordinary be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, with the due allowance of Stipend, he left. That also the liberty of departing, in writing, and <hi>gratis,</hi> to be granted for above the space of Two Months, unless for some weighty cause, be not obtained. But if, by this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, though not personally, they be summoned and be obstinate, it willeth, That it be lawful for the Ordinaries, by Ecclesiastical Censures, and Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taking away of Fruits, and other remedies of Law, even by privation to force them; nor that this execution, by any Privilege, Licence, Familiarity, Exemption, or any reason of any Benefice, Covenant, Statute, Oath, even by any Authority or Custom confirmed, thô immemorable, which are rather to be thought Corruptions; or by Appeals, or an Inhibition even in the <hi>Romish</hi> Cure, or by force of the <hi>Eugenian</hi> Constitution, be not suspended. Lastly, that as well that Decree made under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, as this same, in Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Episcopal be published, the holy Synod hath determined; for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, That those things which are of the Office of Pastors and safety of Souls be frequently fixed in the Ears and Minds; that for the time to come, by the help of God, no Injuries of Times, either by forgetfulness of Men, or Disuse, they may be abolish'd.</p>

Into this College let them be received, who are at the least Twelve years of Age, born in lawful Wedlock, and have a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Reading and Writing, and whose Towardliness and Disposition of mind, gives encouraging hopes of Expectation of their being always hereafter capable to serve in Ecclesiastical Ministeries. But the Synod willeth, That the Children of Poor Men be especially chosen, and yet it excludeth not those of Rich Men; so that they be Nurtured at their own costs and charges, and dedicate their Studies to the Service of God and the Church.

Let the Bishop take care, that they be every day present at the Sacrifice of the Mass; and every month at least let them confess their Sins, and according to the Judgment of the Confesser, let them take the Body of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and on Holy days let them serve at the Cathedral, and the other Churches of the place. All which, and other matters convenient and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this matter, every Bishop with the counsel and advice of Two of their senior and graver <hi>Canons,</hi> whom they shall elect, as the Holy Ghost shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, shall constitute and appoint, and shall endeavour by their frequent Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the same be observed and kept.

But if the Prelates of Cathedrals and other great Churches, shall be negligent in this erecting of a Seminary, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or preserving thereof, and shall refuse to pay their portion; the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop ought sharply to correct the Bishop, and a provincial Synod the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Superiors, and to compel them to perform all the abovesaid Premises; and shall diligently take care, that this holy and pious Work be with all possible speed promoted and advanced, wheresoever it shall happen to be done.

                     <p>Furthermore, that provision may be made, that the Institution of such Schools may be with less charge and cost; the holy Synod ordains, That the Bishops, Archbishops, Primates, and other Ordinaries of places, do enjoyn (even by withdrawing their Revenues) all School-masters and others, who, besides their other Duties, have the charge of Reading and Teaching, to teach in the said Schools those who are there to be instructed by themselves, f they are sit, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by fit Substitutes, to be chosen by the said School-masters, and to be approved of by the Ordinaries. But if in the Judgment of the Bishop they shall not be worthy, let them nominate another who is worthy without any Appeal
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102311:75"/>at all; if he slight and dispise it, the Bishop shall depute one. However the aforesaid Persons shall not teach any thing, but what the Bishop thinks fit or allows of. And the said Offices or Dignities, (<hi>viz.</hi> of Masters of Schools) shall not from henceforth be conferred but on Doctors, Masters, or Licentiates in Divinity, or in the <hi>Canon</hi>-Law, or other sit persons, and who are able of themselves to discharge that Office: Any other Provision made to the contrary being null, and of no force: Notwistanding any Privileges or Customs, thô time out of mind.</p>
                     <p>But in case in any Province Churches labour under so great poverty, that a College cannot be erected therein, a Provincial or Metropolitan Synod, together with two of the Elder Suffragans in the Metropolitan Church, or in some other more convenient Church of the Province, shall take care that one or more Colleges, as shall be thought proper and fit, be erected, out of the Profits or Incomes of Two or more Churches, in each of which a College cannot handsomely be Founded, where the Children of those Churches may be Educated and brought up.</p>

                  <p>THE first Parent of Mankind, by the instinct of the Holy Spirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the perpetual and indissoluble Tye of Matrimony, when he said, <hi>This is now Bone of my Bones, and Flesh of my Flesh: Therefore shall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and shall cleave to his Wife, and they twain shall be one Flesh.</hi> Now that by this Bond two only are coupled and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> hath plainly taught, when rehearsing those last Words, as it were uttered by God; Therefore <hi>now they are no more two, but one flesh;</hi> and immediately confirmed the soundness of that Tye, pronounced so long before by <hi>Adam,</hi> in these Words; <hi>What therefore God hath joyned together, let no Man put asunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Grace, which should perfect that natural Love, and confirm the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble Union, and sanctifie those that are joyned, Christ himself, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor and compleator of venerable Sacraments, hath by his Passion merited for us, which <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle intimateth, saying, <hi>Husbands, Love your Wives, as Christ loved his Church, and gave himself for it;</hi> immediately adding, <hi>This is the great Sacrament; but I say in Christ and in the Church.</hi>

                     <p>ALtho' it is not to be doubted, That clandestine Marriages, made by the free Consent of the Parties, are lawful and true, as long as the Church hath not made them invalid; and therefore they are to be condemn'd as the Holy Synod doth anathematize them, who deny them to be lawful and true; and who falsely affirm, That Marriages contracted without the consent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are void, and the Parents may annul or confirm them: Nevertheless the Holy Church of God, upon just causes, hath always detested, and prohibited them. And because the Holy Synod seriously considereth, that these Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by reason of Men's disobedience, do no good, and that grievous sins arise from the said clandestine Marriages, but especially of those, who having left their former Wife, with whom they had privately contracted, do marry open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publickly with another, and with her live in perpetual Adultery: To help which Evil, seeing the Church, who judgeth not of hidden things, is not able, except some more efficacious remedy be applied; The Holy Synod there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, treading in the steps of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, celebrated under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, doth command, That hereafter, before the Matrimony be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it be publickly denounced in the Church between the solemnizations of Masses, three times on three Festival-days successively, by their own Parish Priest, between whom such Marriage is to be contracted: which Publications being made (if there be found no lawful Impediment) he may proceed to celebrate the Marriage in the face of the Church; where the Parish Priest having asked the Man and the Woman, and heard their mutual consent, shall either say, <hi>I joyn you in Matrimony in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> or may use other words, according to the received Rite of each Province. But if at any time there shall be a probable suspicion that a Marriage is malitiously impeded and hindred, after so many Publications [or <hi>Biddings of the Banes</hi>] have been made before; Then shall one Publication only be made, and the Marriage shall be celebrated by the Parish Priest in the presence of Two or Three Witnesses.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102311:77"/>Furthermore, the said Publications shall be made in the Church before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating of the said Marriage, to the end that if any Impediments be found, they may the easilier be discovered; except the Ordinary shall judge it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to omit the aforesaid Denunciations, [or Publications] which the Holy Synod refers to his prudence and judgment. Whosoever shall attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Marriage without the presence of the Parish Priest, or some other Priest Licensed by the said Parish Priest, or the Ordinary, and two or three witnesses; the Holy Synod declares them altogether uncapable of such Marrying, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees such like Contracts to be void and null, as by this present Decree it nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and makes them of no effect. Moreover it Commands, That the Parish Priest, or any other Priest, who with less number of Witnesses, as also those Witnesses who shall be present at such Contracts without the Parish Priest or some other Priest, as also the persons making such Contracts shall be severely punished, as the Ordinary shall think fit. Further, the said Holy Synod ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, That the persons Married do not live together in the same House before the Benediction of the Priest, which is to be received in the Church; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains that the Benediction be given by their own Parish Priest, nor may licence be granted to any other Priest to give the aforesaid Benediction, by any but from the said Parish Priest or the Ordinary; any Custom thô time out of mind, (which may rather be called a Corruption) or Privilege to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notwithstanding. But if any Parish Priest, or any other Priest, whether Regular or Secular, althô they may challenge such power to themselves, by any Privilege, thô time out of mind, shall dare to Marry, or bless the married Persons of another Parish, without the licence of the Priest of that Parish, he shall <hi>(ipso jure)</hi> so long remain Suspended, till he shall be Absolved by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of that Parish Priest, who ought to have been concerned in the Marriage, and from whom the Benediction was to be received. The Parish Priest shall likewise have a Book, wherein he may write down and register the Names of the married persons, and the day and place of the Matrimonial Contract; which Book he shall carefully keep by him. Lastly, the Holy Synod exhorts those that are to be Married, That before they Contract, or at least three days before the Consummation of the Marriage, they diligently Confess, and piously come to the most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist. And in case there be any Provinces which use any other laudable Customs and Ceremonies, besides those before mentioned, the Holy Synod earnestly desireth them to keep and retain them. But lest these so wholesome Precepts may lie concealed from the knowledge of any, it commandeth all Ordinaries, That, with all speed possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they take care this Decree be published to the People, and explained in all and singular the Parish Churches of their respective Diocesses; and that they do this for the first as oft as may be; and afterwards, as often as they shall think expedient. Moreover it Orders, That this Decree be in full force in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish after thirty days, to be accounted from the day of its first Publication made in the said Parishes respectively.</p>

                     <p>EXperience teacheth us, That by reason of the multitude of Prohibitions, Marriages are very often contracted in cases prohibited; wherein people do go on either not without great Sin, or the said Marriages are annulled not without great Scandal: The Holy Synod therefore, willing to provide against this Inconvenience, and beginning with the Impediment of spiritual Cognati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth appoint. That one person only, whether Man or Woman, according to the Institutions of the Holy Canons, do undertake as God-father or God-mother for one in Baptism; between whom and the party Baptized, and the Father and Mother, as also between the Baptizer and the Baptized, and the Parents of the Baptized alone, a spiritual Cognation or Kindred may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Let the Parish Priest, before he go to confer Baptism, diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, of those unto whom it shall appertain, what person or persons they have chosen that shall undertake for the baptized Child at the holy Font; and let him admit him or them alone to undertake for it; and register their Names in a Book; and let him inform and teach them what Kindred and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance they have contracted; that they may not pretend any ignorance for their Excuse. But if any others, besides the persons designed, shall touch the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, let them by no means contract a spiritual Cognation or Kindred; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Constitutions made to the contrary. If by the fault or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Parish Priest, it shall be done otherwise, let him be punished at the pleasure of the Ordinary. That Kindred also, which is contracted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, shall be restrained to the Confirmer, and the person Confirmed, and his Parents: All impediments of this spiritual Alliance and Kindred between other persons totally laid aside and made void.</p>

                     <p>THE Impediment of Honesty of publick Justice, when Marriages shall not for any reason be valid and of force, the Holy Synod wholly takes away, and nullifies; but where they shall be valid and effectual, they may not exceed the first Degree; because in degrees farther off, such Prohibition cannot now be observed without Expence.</p>

But in Degrees farther off it ordains, That such Affinity shall not take away or annul the Marriage afterwards contracted.</p>

                     <p>IF any one within the Degrees prohibited, shall presume wittingly to contract Marriage, let the same be broken and made void, and the person deprived of all hope of obtaining a Dispensation; and let this more especially concern and respect him, who shall not only dare to Contract Marriage, but also to Consummate it. But if any shall do this ignorantly, for that he neglected and omitted the solemnities requisite for Matrimonial Contracts, he shall be subject and lyable to the same punishments; for he is not worthy of experiencing the Clemency and Bounty of the Church, who rashly despised her wholesome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But if, having used the solemnities, it be afterwards known that there was any Impediment, which he was probably ignorant of; then a Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may the more easily be given him, and that <hi>gratis.</hi> In contracting Marriages, a Dispensation may never be given, or very seldom; and then it shall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a just cause, and <hi>gratis.</hi> In the second degree a Dispensation shall never be had, except among great Princes, and for a publick cause.</p>

But if the Woman stoln, being separated from the <hi>Raptor,</hi> and kept in a safe and free place, shall consent to have him for her Husband; he that stole her may have her for his Wife. Nevertheless, the said <hi>Raptor,</hi> and all those that assist him with their Counsel, Aid and Favour, shall be <hi>(ipso jure)</hi> Excommunicated, and for ever infamous, and incapable of all Dignity; and if they be Clergy-men, they shall be degraded.

                     <p>IT is a grievous Sin, for Men loosned from the Bonds of Matrimony to have their Concubines; but most dismal of all, and committed in the notorious contempt of this great Sacrament, that married Men also live in this state of Damnation, and dare to maintain and keep them sometimes at home even with their Wives. Wherefore the Holy Synod, to the end it might provide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and suitable Remedies for this so great an Evil, doth ordain and appoint, That such <hi>Concubinaries</hi> (or Keepers of Concubines) aswell unmarried, as married, of what state, dignity and condition soever they be, if after they shall have been admonished thrice by the Ordinary, according to his Duty, they shall not put away their Concubines, and separate themselves from the company and usage of them, they shall be Excommunicated; from which they shall not be Absolved until they really obey the Admonition to them given. But if, having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Censures, they shall for a year after, still persevere in keeping their Concubines, the Ordinary shall proceed severely against them, according to the quality of the Crime. And the Women, married or unmarried, who publickly and openly live with such Adulterers, and Keepers of Concubines, if being thrice admonished, they shall not submit to and obey such Admonition, the Ordinaries of the places, shall (thô required thereunto by none) pursuant to their Duty, severely punish them according to the measure and heinousness of such their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and, if the Ordinaries shall think fit, they shall be chased out of the Town or Diocess, by the asistance of the secular power if their be need: All other penalties and punishments inflicted on Adulterers, and keepers of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, remaining in their full strength and virtue.</p>

Wherefore, seeing it is a most wicked and nefarious thing, to violate the Liberty of Matrimony; and that Injustice and Wrongs are done by those, from whom Justice and Right are expected: The Holy Synod chargeth and commandeth all persons, of what degree, dignity and condition soever they be, that upon pain of Excommunication and <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> which they incurr by so doing, they do not in any wise direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly compel and force their Subjects, or any others, to Marry; but to let them freely marry, according to their own choice and liking.</p>

                     <p>IF in some degrees or Offices of the Church a provident and watchful Care is to be taken, that nothing be disorderly or preposterous in the House of God, how much more must we labour and study, that no Error be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Choice and Election of him, who is constituted the Head over all degrees. For the state and order of the whole Family of the Lord will droop and totter, if the Head doth not supply that which is required of the Body. Whereupon, althô the Holy Synod hath at other times decreed some things advantageous and profitable for those that are to be advanced to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral and Superior Churches: Yet it judgeth this Office and Charge to be of so considerable a nature, that when it weigheth the Greatness of the matter in the Balance of a due Consideration, no Care can seem sufficient, or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too great for the same. Wherefore it ordains, That assoon as any Church shall be vacant, Supplications and Prayers shall be publickly and privately made, and shall be enjoyned by the Chapter throughout the City and Diocess, by which the Clergy and People may be enabled to beg and implore God for a good and able Pastor. But exhorts and admonisheth all and every the persons, who have any Right, upon any account from the Apostolick See, to the Promoting of the superior Clergy, or otherwise shall assist and help the same, having no desire for innovations or adapting things to the present state of the times, That they first and chiefly remember, that they can do or act nothing more conducing to God's Glory, and the Welfare and Salvation of the People, than that they study to promote good Pastors, and those that are fit and proper for the Government of the Church; and that they, communicating with the sins of others, do mortally sin, if they do not use all diligence to prefer those they shall judge more worthy and profitable for the Church, not guided by Intreaties, or humane Affections, or the suggestions of Pretenders or Flatterers, but by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102311:79"/>their own Demerits; who are likewise born of lawful Matrimony, and whom they know deserving both for Life, Age, and Doctrine, and endowed with such other qualifications, which are required by the Holy Canons, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of this Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> And because in taking the grave and fit testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of good and learned Men, concerning all the aforesaid qualities, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form method cannot be used, in all places, by reason of the Variety of Nations, People, Customs and Manners; the Holy Synod commands, That in a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synod, to be holden by the Metropolitan, a certain proper Form be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to some Places and Provinces, for making Examinations, Inquisitions, or Instructions, to be approved and allowed of by the judgment of his Holiness the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which shall seem most profitable, fit and suitable for the said places: With this Proviso nevertheless, That immediately after such Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inquisition of the person so to be promoted, shall be made and ended; the said Examens shall be reduced into a publick Instrument or Evidence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Testimony and Profession of Faith made by such person, to be transmitted with all possible dispatch to his Holiness the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> that he the said Pope, having a full knowledge and understanding of the Business and Persons, may the better and more advantageously provide for those Churches, for the good and benefit of the Lord's Flock, if by such Examination and Inquisition made they shall be found fit. Moreover, all Inquisitions, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Testimonies, and Approbations whatsoever of, or concerning the Qualities of the person to be promoted, by whomsoever, thô in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, had or made, shall, by the Cardinal, who shall propose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the same in Consistory, and three other Cardinals, be diligently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined: and the said Report or Proposal shall be strengthned and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated by the subscription of the Cardinal (the Reporter) and the other three Cardinals: Wherein every one of the said four Cardinals shall affirm, That they find by a diligent and accurate Enquiry, that the persons to be promoted, are endued with those Qualifications, required by the Law, and this Holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; and do really judge, upon peril of Everlasting Salvation, such persons absolutely fit to be preferred to those Churches. So that the Report being made in one Consistory, to the end that the said Inquisition may the sooner be known, the judgment thereof may be referred to another Consistory; unless his Holiness shall think otherwise convenient. And the said Synod Decrees, That all and singular other things which are required for the Life, Age, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and other the Qualifications otherwise appointed in this Holy Synod, of Bishops to be promoted, shall be still observed, in the creation of Cardinals of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thô but Deacons; whom his Holiness the Pope shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume out of all Nations of Christendom, as far as conveniently he may, and as he shall think them fit. Lastly, the said most Holy Synod, moved by the great Inconveniences of the Church, cannot but remember, That nothing is more necessary for the Church of God, than that his Holiness, according as he is in Duty bound in his Care of the Universal Church, do most especially employ his utmost Circumspection in the assuming and creating to himself Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and that he prefer and place fit and good Pastors over every Church; and the rather because our Lord Jesus Christ will require the Blood of his

Metropolitans shall not visit the Cathedral Churches, nor the Diocesses of their Suffragans, thô they have made a full Visitation of their own respective Diocesses, except it be for a Cause known and approved in the Provincial Council. Archdeacons also and Deacons and other Inferiors shall henceforth visit those Churches, where they have been hitherto accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawfully to make such Visitation, by themselves alone in person, taking with them a Notary, by the consent of the Bishop.

Also in those Cities and places, where the Parish Churches have no certain Confines, or Bounds, nor the Rectors of them any proper people to govern, but do promiscuously and indifferently administer the Sacraments to those that desire them; the Holy Synod commands the Bishops, That for the more safe and sure Salvation of the Souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge, having distinguished and confined the People into their certain and proper Parishes, they shall assign and appoint to each of them, their perpetual and peculiar Parish Priests, who may take cognizance of them, and from whom alone they shall receive the Sacraments; or they shall provide for them in a more advantageous manner, as the quality of the place shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

                     <p>SEeing Ecclesiastical Order is perverted, when one Clerk doth occupy and possess the Offices of many, it hath been piously provided in the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, That no one person ought to be entitled and admitted into Two Churches: And because there are many, who, led by wicked Desires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, deceiving themselves, not <hi>God,</hi> are not ashamed to elude and shift off by divers subtle Arts those things which were well and happily constituted, and to obtain many Benefices together at once: The holy Synod, desiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store a due and orderly Discipline in the Government of Churches, doth, by this present Decree (which it commands to be observed by all persons whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by what Title or Dignity soever they are distinguished, thô Cardinals) ordain and appoint, That from henceforth one Ecclesiastical Benefice only shall be conferred on one person: To which, if it be not sufficient for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent and honest Maintenance for him on whom it is so conferred, one other simple Benefice may be also added; so that they do not both require per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Residence.

                     <p>IT is highly expedient, for the Salvation of Souls, that they be governed and guided by worthy and able Parish Priests. And to the end this may be carefully and rightly performed, the holy Synod ordains and appoints, That when a Vacancy of a Parish Church (although the Care of the Church may be said to be incumbent on the Bishop, and may be governed by one or more, even in Patrimonial Churches, or that are called <hi>Receptive</hi> Churches, wherein the Bishop hath been wont to give the Cure of Souls to One or Many, all which persons the Synod commands be obliged to the following Trial and Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) shall, by Death, or Resignation happen, either in the Court, or otherwise howsoever, although the said Parish Church be generally or specially reserved and affected, by virtue of any Indulgence or Privilege in favour of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Abbots, or Chapters of the holy Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> The Bishop ought
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102311:85"/>immediately, upon the knowledge of the Vacancy of the said Church, to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and appoint, if need be, a fit Vicar in the same; together with a suitable Assignation of a portion of the Income, at his pleasure; who may sustain the Charges and Burthen of the said Church, until it shall be provided with a Rector. Moreover the Bishop and the Patron, within ten days, or at such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time as the Bishop shall limit and appint, shall nominate and propose some other sit Clerks for the governing the said Church, before Examiners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for that purpose. And it shall nevertheless be free for any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also, to set down in writing the Names of such as they know sit for the said Preferment, that afterwards a diligent Inquisition may be made of the Age, Manners and Sufficiency of every of them. And if the Bishop, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod shall think it more convenient, according to the Custom of the Country, they may summon by a publick Edict, those they are pleased to have examined. After the time limited and appointed is past, all such as were noted and set down in writing, shall be examined by the Bishop, or if he be hindred, by his Vicar General, and three other Examiners at the least; to whose Voices (or Votes) whether they be even or odd, the Bishop, or his Vicar may add theirs, as they shall think fit. And such Examiners as aforesaid shall every year be proposed in the Diocesan Synod by the Bishop, or his Vicar, to the number, at least, of six, for the satisfaction of the Synod, and its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. And upon the falling of a Vacancy of any Church, the Bishop shall choose six of them, for the making the Examinations with him. And after, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other Vacancy following, he may elect out of the aforesaid six, either the same three, or three others, as he shall like best. And these Examiners, being Masters, Doctors, or Licentiates in Divinity, or the Canon Law, or such other Clerks or Regulars, thô of the Order of the Mendicants, or Seculars, as shall be judged most fit for that purpose, shall swear upon the holy Gospels, that without any humane affection whatsoever, they will duly and faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute and perform their Duty. And they shall be cautious that they receive not any thing, either before or after the Examination, for, or by reason of the same: And if they do otherwise, they, the Receivers as well as the persons the Givers to, shall incur the guilt of Simony; from which they cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, but by quitting and leaving those Benefices, which they have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any manner obtained, and be made uncapable of any others for the time to come. And of all these things they shall be obliged to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not only before God, but also before the Provincial Synod, if need be; by whom, if it be found that they have done or committed any thing contrary to their Duty, they may be punished, as shall be judged fit. And after the Examination is ended, they shall declare and report, how many they have judged fit, for Age, Manners, Prudence, Learning, and other Qualifications, proper for the governing the vacant Church; amongst which the Bishop shall elect that person, whom he shall judge the most fit and sufficient; and upon him and no other, the Collation of the Church shall be made by him, to whom it shall belong to confer it. But if the Patronage be Ecclesiastical, and the Institution belongs to the Bishop and no other, then whomsoever the Patron shall judge most worthy amongst those that are approved by the Examiners,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102311:86"/>he shall be obliged to present to the Bishop, to be ordained by him. But when the Ordination is to be made by any other; then the Bishop alone shall elect the most worthy, whom the Patron shall present to him, to whom the Ordination doth appertain. But if the Patronage be Laick, he that shall be presented by the Patron, shall be Examined by the said deputed Examiners as abovesaid, and not admitted, except he be found to be fit. And in all the abovesaid cases, the Church shall make Provision for no other, than One of those that have been Examined as aforesaid, and approved of by the Examiners, according to the aforesaid Rule; nor shall any Devolution or Appeal, thô made to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See, or the Legates, Vice-Legates or Nuncios, Bishops, Metropolitans, Primates or Patriarchs of the said See, hinder, or suspend the Execution of the report of the aforesaid Examiners. Nor shall the Vicar, whom the Bishop hath deputed, or perhaps hereafter shall depute for a time at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, unto the vacant Church, be removed from the custody, care and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the said Church, until Provision be made, either for him or some other, who shall be elected and approved as abovesaid: Otherwise all Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Ordinations made over and besides the abovesaid form, shall be judged and reckon'd Surreptitious: All Exceptions, Indulgences, Privileges, Preventions, Affections, new Provisions or Indulgences granted to any Universities, thô to a certain Summ, and all other Inpediments whatsoever to the contrary of this Decree notwithstanding. Yet if the said Parochial Revenues be so small, that they cannot bear the Charge of all this Examination; or that there is no person that stands in need of such Examination; or that by reason of open Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or Dissentions, which in some places are found, grievous and lamentable Quarrels and Tumults may be easily stirred up; the Ordinary (if in his own Conscience, with the advice of the Deputies, he shall think it so convenient) may omit this Form, and use any other Examination; observing nevertheless such other matters as are abovemention'd. Moreover it may and shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Provincial Synod, to take care and provide, if it shall judge that there is any thing to be added or taken away in the aforesaid Matters touching the form of Examination.</p>

From these are excepted such Causes, which according to the Sanctions of the holy Canons, are to be handled and treated of by the Apostolick See, or which upon urgent and reasonable cause, the Pope shall think fit, by a special Rescript, under the Signature of his Holiness, and Subscribed by his own Hand, to commit to anothers Charge, or to call to himself. Moreover, matrimonial and criminal Causes shall not be left to the Judgment of the Dean, Archdeacon, or other Inferiors, even in their Visitation, but shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the Examination and Jurisdiction of the Bishop only; altho any suit, in any instance, doth at that very time depend between the Bishop and Dean, or Archdeacon, or other Inferiors about taking Cognizance of such Causes: Before whom, if the Matrimonial party shall be proved to be poor, they shall not be forced to litigate or debate the same cause out of the Province, neither in the second or third Instance; except the adverse party shall be willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Diet, and bear the charges of the Suit. Legates also, thô <hi>de Latere,</hi> Nuncios, Ecclesiastical Governors, or any others, by virtue of any Faculties or Powers, shall not presume to hinder, or in any wise prevent or disturb the Jurisdiction, not only of Bishops in the aforesaid Causes; but also shall not proceed against any Clerks, or other Ecclesiastical persons, except first required so to do by the Bishop, and in case of his Negligence. All their Processes or Ordinations to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shall be void and of no force, and they shall be bound to make such satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions for Damages, as the parties shall lay upon them. Furthermore, if any person shall Appeal in cases permitted by the Law, or shall make complaint of any Grievance, or that shall otherwise have recourse to another Judge, in as much as the limited time of Two Years is elapsed; he shall be oblig'd to bring at his own Charges, the Acts made before the Bishop, unto the Judge of the Appeal; the Bishop having first admonished him, that if he thinks he shall stand in need of any further Instruction in the Cause, he may signifie it to the Judge of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. But if the Appealed shall appear, then he likewise shall be forced to pay proportionable Charges for the Copying the said Acts, if he be willing to make use of them; except it be otherwise provided by the Custom of the place, that this Charge shall wholly belong to the Appellant to pay. Moreover, the

Which Notary, if he shall commit any fraud or deceit, in delaying the giving such Copy, he shall be suspended, at the pleasure of the Ordinary, from the Administration of his Office, and shall be forced to pay double the Costs of the suit, to be distributed between the Appellant and the Poor of the Place. And if the Judge himself shall be conscious or partaker of such Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or Hindrance, or shall otherwise withstand the delivery of all such Acts to the Appellant, within the time limited; he shall be obliged to pay double the costs, as aforesaid: Any Privileges, Indulgences, Agreements, (which bind only their Authors) and any other Customs whatsoever to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereof notwithstanding.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the Invocation, Worship, and Relicks of the Saints, and holy Images.</head>
                  <p>THE holy Synod commands all Bishops and others that have the Charge and Care of Teaching, that according to the Usage of the Catholick and Apostolick Church, received from the primitive times of Christianity, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the holy Fathers, and Decrees of Councils, they diligently instruct the People, chiefly concerning the Intercession and Invocation of Saints, Honour
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102311:88"/>of Relicks, and the lawful Use of Images: Teaching them, that the Saints, reigning together with Christ, do offer up their Prayers to God for Men; That it is good and profitable humbly to invocate them, and to have recourse to their Prayers, help and assistance, for the imploring benefits from God by his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord, who is our alone Saviour and Redeemer. But that those, who deny that the Saints, enjoying eternal happiness in Heaven, ought to be invoked; or who assert, that they do not pray for Men; and that it is Idolatry to Invoke them to pray for us particularly or singularly; or that it is repugnant to the Word of God, and contrary to the honour of the <hi>one Mediator</hi> between God and Man, <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> that it is a foolish thing, to pray to those that are Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Heaven, either with Heart or Voice; do entertain wicked and ungodly Thoughts and Opinions.</p>
                  <p>That the sacred bodies of Holy Martyrs, and others Reigning with Christ, who were the living Members of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy-Ghost, and by him to be raised up unto eternal Life and Glorification, are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by the Faithful, for whose sakes God shews many kindnesses and benefits to Men: So that they who affirm, that Veneration and Honour are not due to the Relicks of Saints; or that it is useless or unprofitable to honour them, or any of their holy Monuments or Sepultures; and that it is vain to make frequent mention of the Saints, for the obtaining their Aid: Such persons are to be highly condemned, as the Church hath long since, and now also doth condemn them. Moreover, That the Images of Christ, of the Virgin, and of other Saints, ought especially to be had and kept in Churches, and to have due Honour and Veneration given them: Not that it is believed that there is any Divinity or Virtue in them, for which they are to be Worshipped, or that any thing is to be begged from them, or that any Confidence or Trust is to be reposed in Images, as the Heathens heretofore did, who placed their hopes in Idols; but because the Honour, which is given to them, redounds to the Prototypes, which they represent; so that by the Images, which we kiss, and before which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Head, and Prostrate our selves, we worship and adore Christ, and the Saints, whose similitude they bear: As hath been established by Councils, but especially by the Decrees of the second Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> against the Oppugners or Opposers of Images.</p>
                  <p>The Bishops also shall diligently Teach and suggest, that by the Histories of the Misteries of our Redemption, expressed in Pictures, and other Similitudes, the people are instructed and confirmed, in remembring and daily calling to mind the Articles of Faith: As likewise the extraordinary fruit and profit is received from all Holy Images; not only because the people are admonished of the Benefits and Gifts which are conferred upon them by Christ, but also because the Miracles and wholsome examples of the Saints are set before their eyes, that they may thank God for them, and imitate them in their Lives and Conversations; and may be stirred up to adore and love God, and exercise and delight in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But if any one shall teach or believe contrary to these Decrees, let him be accursed.</p>
                  <p>And if any abuses have crept into those wholsome and pious Observances, the Holy Synod earnestly desires, that they be utterly abolished and taken away; so that no Images of a false stamp be set up, to give occasion to the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people to fall into dangerous errors. But if at any time it shall happen, that it

Moreover, all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in the Invocation of Saints, Worshipping of Relicks, and in the holy use of Images shall be taken away, all dishonest and base Gain abolished, and finally all Excess avoided; so that Images shall not be painted and adorned with any lascivious Ornaments; nor shall men abuse themselves with Banquetting and Drunkenness in Celebrating the Festivals of Saints, and visitation of Relicks; as if Festival days, intended for the Honour of the Saints, should be kept in luxury and wantonness. Lastly, so great is the Diligence and Care the Bishop ought to take about these things, that nothing may appear disorderly or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous, or done in a hurly-burly, nothing profane or dishonest, seeing holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and devoutness becometh the house of God: To the end therefore these things may be the more faithfully and duly observed, the Holy Synod ordains, That it shall be lawful for none, to put, or cause to be put up in any place or Church, though exempt, any unusual Image, except it shall be approved of by the Bishop; nor shall any new Miracles be admitted, or new Relicks received, without the knowledge and approbation of the Bishop; who, as soon as any such thing shall be known abroad, and come to his ears, shall with the counsel and advice of some Divines, and other Godly Men, do whatsoever he shall judge consentaneous and agreeable to Truth and Godliness. But in case any doubtful or difficult Abuse be to be removed, and extirpated, or any weighty question arise about these things; the Bishop, before he determine the controversie, shall expect the Opinion of the Metropolitan, and his Co-Provincial Bishops in the Provincial Council; yet so, that nothing new, or hitherto unusual in the Church be decreed, without the consent of his Holiness, the Pope.</p>

And the Bishop or Superior ought only to give License in necessary Cases, nor may in any wise do it in any other respects, even by vertue of any other Power or Indulgence hitherto granted, or hereafter to be granted. And because the Cloisters of Nuns, Founded without the Walls of Cities or Towns, are exposed to the Prey and Robbery of wicked men, and other evil outrages oftentimes, without any guard; the Bishops and other Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours shall take care, if it be thought expedient, that the Nuns be brought from those, to the new or ancient Monasteries that are within the Cities, and Towns frequented and resorted to; calling also the Secular Power, if need so require, to their assistance herein.

                     <p>WHereas many Monasteries, Abbeys, Priories, and <hi>Provostships,</hi> through the ill government of those to whom they have been committed, have sustained great losses and damages both in their spiritual and temporal Concerns; The Holy Synod doth earnestly desire to reduce them to such Discipline, as doth become a Monastical life. But the condition of the present time, is so bad, that it is a very difficult matter to effect it, and almost impossible to apply those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to all persons, and in all places, which are necessary to accomplish the Reformation so much desir'd. However, that we may omit nothing that can be done on our part, and that better provision may be made for the future against the aforesaid Evils, First we hope his Holiness will out of his own Piety and Prudence take care (so far as the times will <hi>permit</hi>) that there be plac'd oversuch
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102311:93"/>Religious Houses as are held in <hi>Commendam,</hi> and have Chapters of their own, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars to govern them, who have themselves made profession of the same Order that the several Houses are of, that so they may give good example to such as are under their Charge. And that all Vacancies in time to come may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Regulars of approved Virtue and Holyness.</p>
                     <p>As for those Monasteries which are called the Heads and Chief of the Orders, whether Abbeys or Priories, the Daughters of those Heads, they who at present hold them in <hi>Commendams</hi> (unless there be some Regular person provided to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them) shall be obliged within Six Months next ensuing, solemnly to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves of those Orders which the Houses they hold are of, or else quit their places; Otherwise the said <hi>Commendams</hi> shall be adjudged lawfully vacant.</p>
                     <p>And lest any fraud should be used in all or any of the Decrees before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Holy Synod doth command, That in making Provision for the said Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries the Quality of every Governour shall be named and expresly set down, and any Provision made to the contrary, shall be accounted Surreptitious, and no Possession thereupon given, though of Three years continuance, shall be of force to confirm and make good the said Provision.</p>

                     <p>But if there be any Regulars either Men or Women, who live under a stricter Rule or Statutes (except the power of having goods settled in common) the Holy Synod doth not hereby intend, to remove or hinder them from the observing their own order and manner of Living. And because the Holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod is very desirous, that all and singular the premises should be spedily put in Execution, it doth strictly charge and require all Bishops to take care, that they be forthwith observ'd in all Monasteries subject to them, and in all others, that are particularly committed to their Care by the Decrees above mentioned, and in all Abbeys, and by Generals and all other Superiors of the Orders aforesaid; and if any thing be not put in execution, the Provincial Councils must perform what is left undone through the negligence of the Bishops, and prevent such neglect for the future: And the Provincial and General Chapters or Assemblies of the Regulars; and for want of a General Assembly, the Provincial Councils by a Deputation granted to some of the same Order, shall provide against it.

                     <p>IT is to be wished that all those who undertake the Office of a Bishop, did rightly understand their duty; and that they would consider that they are not called unto that dignity for their own profit or advantage, for the gaining of Riches, or promoting their Luxury, but unto much Labour and Pains, and care for the Glory of God. For it is not to be doubted, that all other believers are more readily stirred up unto a Religious and Innocent Life, when they see their Guides not to mind the things of the World, but the good of Souls and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country.</p>
                     <p>Which things the Holy Synod having considered, and knowing they would tend very much toward the restoring of the Ecclesiastical Discipline; it doth exhort all Bishops, That they would bethink themselves, how by their Works and common Actions or behaviour in their Lives (which is as it were a kind of Preaching) they may walk agreeable to their Function; and especially that their Manners may be such, that others may from them fetch examples of Frugality, Modesty, Chastity, and of that which so much recomends us to God, a holy Humility, and Meekness in word and deed: And therefore after the example of our Fore-Fathers in the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> the Holy Council doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that Bishops be content with a mean Furniture for their Houses, a moderate Provision for their Table, and that they take heed that nothing in their manner of living or house-keeping appear contrary to the holy Institution, and which doth not manifest that simplicity or plainness becoming a Christian, or that zeal for God which they ought always to shew, together with a Contempt of all worldly Vanities; and it doth wholly forbid them to study the enriching of their friends and kindred out of the Revenues of the Church; for even the Apostolical Canons do forbid the giving of the Goods of the Church (pertaining only to God) to any of our Relations. But if they be poor, you may give to them as you do to the poor, but must not for their sake wast or consume the Goods of the Church. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Holy Synod doth admonish them, as far is possible, wholly to lay aside all humane affection towards their Brethren, Nephews, or other kindred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh, which hath been the occasion of many Evils in the Churrh.</p>
                     <p>And those things which have been said concerning Bishops, the Synod doth decree to be observ'd, not only by all those who are in any Ecclesiastical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102311:94"/>either Secular or Regular, according to their respective places, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend also to the Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, upon whose Counsel and advice to his Holyness, the administration of the affairs of the Catholick Church doth so much depend; it would seem a wickedness not to have them shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others in all those eminent Virtues and Holyness of Life, which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly attract the eyes of all that behold their exemplary Conversation.</p>

                     <p>THe Calamity and sad estate of the present times, and the Wickedness of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies daily encreasing, do require that nothing should be left undone which may in any wise tend to the Edification of Christian people, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Catholick Faith. And therefore the holy Synod doth will and command the Patriarchs, Primates, Arch-bishops, Bishops, and all others which of right and custome ought to be present at any Provincial Council, that at the first Provincial Council which shall be held, after the end of this present Council, they publickly receive all and singular the Decrees which shall be made, defin'd, and ordain'd by this present holy Synod. And they shall also promise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess true obedience to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all shall publickly. declare their abhorrence of, and denounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against all those Heresies which have been condemn'd by the Sacred Canons and General Councils, more especially by this present Council. The same also shall they strictly observe, who at any time hereafter are chosen to be Patriarchs, Primates, Arch-bishops or Bishops, in the first Provincial Council that they are at after such their promotion.</p>

And all others who are at present, or shall hereafter be Beneficed, and ought to meet at the Synod of their Diocess, shall do and observe what is above-mentioned, in that Synod that shall be first kept in the said Diocess.

                     <p>ALthough the Sword of Excommunication be the very Sinews or chief sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Ecclesiastical Discipline, and very wholsome and necessary for the keeping of People in their Obedience and Duty, yet is it to be made use of with great Caution and Circumspection; since Experience teacheth us, that if it be us'd indiscreetly, or for light and trivial matters, it is rather despis'd than fear'd, and, instead of saving, destroys. And therefore those Excommunications which after admonitions are commonly issued forth to make discovery (as they term it) of things that are lost or stoln away, shall be denounced by none but the Bishop himself; and not then neither but upon an extraordinary occasion, and mature deliberation and diligent examination of the Cause, for which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that Excommunication. Nor shall he be induced to grant the said Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by the perswasion of any Secular person or Magistrate whatsoever. But it shall be wholly done according to the Bishops own Pleasure and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whenever he thinketh fit to decree the same, as the matter, place, persons or times do require.</p>
                     <p>But in Judicial Causes the holy Synod commandeth all Judges Ecclesiastical, of whatsoever Quality they be, that whensoever any Execution, Real or Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in any part of their Judicature is to be made by them, according to the power and authority belonging to them, they shall wholly forbear both in their Process and Decrees, to use any Ecclesiastical Censures or Interdicts. But it shall be lawful for them, if they think fit, to proceed against all sorts of Lay persons, by pecuniary Mulcts, in any Civil causes in any wise appertaining to the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts. Which pecuniary mulcts shall be by the Judge, who impos'd, assign'd and appointed them, be given to some Religious House, in the place where they are levied, and these mulcts shall be raised, by making a distress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the goods of the Offender, or arresting their persons (either by the Officers of their own Court or by any other) or by depriving them of their Benefices, and such like remedies at Law.</p>
                     <p>But if no execution can this way be made, either upon the person or goods of Offenders, and that they continue contumacious and obstinate against the Judge then may he punish them by Excommunication as he thinks fit, besides the other Penalties which he inflicts upon them.</p>
                     <p>In Criminal Causes also where an Execution can be made either upon the Goods or Person of the Offender as aforesaid, there the Judge shall forbear all other Censures; But if that Execution cannot easily be made, the Judge may make use of the spiritual Sword against the Offenders. But yet if the quality of the Offence so require, let it be after his being twice Summoned to appear by a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is impious for any Secular Magistrate whatsoever to hinder an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Judge from Excommunicating any person, and to command him to recall the Excommunication when issued forth, upon pretence that the conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if any person that is Excommunicated doth not after lawful notice and warning gave him, repent himself of his Offences, he shall not only be refus'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Sacrament and to the fellowship of the Faithful; but if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his obstinacy for the space of a Year under the Censures of the Church, the Judge may proceed against him upon suspicion of his being an Heretick.</p>

                     <p>IT often times falleth out in some certain Churches, that so great a number of Masses are requir'd to be said according to the different Guifts of Persons deceased, left for that purpose, that it is not possible for the Priests to say them all upon those particular days which their Executors have appointed; or else the Alms left for the saying the said Masses is so small, that it is not easie to find any one who will undertake to do it; and hereby the pious Intentions and last Will of the Deceased are frustrated, and <hi>the Consciences of such as are concern'd in those affairs are troubled.</hi> The Holy Synod being desirous that whatsoever is left for pious uses, should be more fully and profitably employed, doth give power unto Bishops, that they in their Diocesan Synod, and to Abbots and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the Orders, that they in their General Chapters or Assemblies, may after due examination of things, determine in these matters what they Judge in their consciences fit to be done in the Churches aforesaid, which need this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, so far as they shall think it most conducing to the Honour and Worship of God and the benefit of those Churches; and yet so as that still there may be a Commemoration of the parties deceased, who for the Salvation, Health, or good of their Souls, left those Legacies for pious uses.</p>

But whenever he prosecutes any out of the time of his Visitation, the following Decrees shall take place; namely, That the Chapter shall at the beginning of every year choose two of their Chapter, by whose Counsel and consent the Bishop, or his Vicar, shall be bound to proceed as well in forming the process as in all other Acts, unto the end of the Cause inclusively; but yet in the presence of the Bishops, Secretary, and in his House, or accustomed place of trying Causes.</p>
                     <p>And what one of them doth, shall be accounted as if done by both: the other may attend and joyn with the Bishop. But if both of them differ from the Bishops opinion in any Act, whether in an Interlocutory or definitive Sense; then shall the Bishop and they choose a third person for Umpire, within six days after. And if they also disagree in the choice of a third person, the choice of him shall devolve unto the next adjoyning Bishop. And the article or point in which they differ'd shall be determined, according to that opinion which the said third person agrees in; otherwise the Process, and what follows thereupon, shall be void and of no effect in Law.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, in Crimes of <hi>Incontinency,</hi> whereof there is mention made in the Decree concerning <hi>Concubinaries,</hi> and in such like more heinous offences, which require a deposing, or a degrading of the Offender, where there is cause to fear his escaping, or flying away, that Justice may not be shifted off, and avoided, and there is therefore a necessity of detaining or keeping the Offender in hold; the Bishop alone may at the beginning proceed against him, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a brief information of his Offence, and keeping him in custody, as need requires.</p>
                     <p>In all other things the Order aforesaid shall be duly observed.</p>

The Bishops shall call the Chapters, demanding their Votes, and determine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; but in the absence of the Bishop it shall be wholly done by those of the Chapter, to whom of right or custom it appertains, and the Bishops Vicars shall not be admitted to do it.</p>

                     <p>THe Holy Synod doth exhort all persons whatsoever, who shall be possess'd of Ecclesiastical Benefices, Secular or Regular, to accustom themselves to perform the duty of Hospitality, which is so often recommended by the Holy Fathers; and this they should do with all possible chearfulness and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, so far as their Ability will give leave; remembring that they who love
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102311:96"/>Hospitality, do often receive Christ in the strangers they entertain. As for those who have in their Possession the places commonly called Hospitals, or any other places of Piety, particularly appointed for the use of Strangers or Travelling Persons, and of such as are sick and weak, or aged and very poor, either in <hi>Commendam</hi> or to govern them, or by any other Title, or lastly as being united to their Churches; or if the Parochial Churches should chance to be united to the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, or turned into Hospitals, and the Government of them granted to such as were the Founders or Donor of them: The Holy Synod doth enjoyn all these, to discharge and perform what they undertake, keeping up that Hospitality which they ought out of the Revenues appointed for that purpose: According to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which hath been elsewhere renewed in this same Synod under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, of happy memory, which Decree begins with these words, <hi>Quia Contingit.</hi> But if these Hospitals were first design'd only for the receiving or entertaining of some certain sort of strangers or infirm persons, or the like; and in the place where such Hospitals are, no such persons, or but very few are there to be found: The Holy Synod doth further Command, that the Revenues belonging to the said Hospitals be converted to some other pious use, as near the intention of the Donor, or first Founder of them, as can be, and for the place and time more profitable and beneficial, according as the Ordinary with two of the Chapter who are skilled in such affairs, to be by him chosen, shall think most expedient; unless there was provision made at the time of their being Founded, for what might happen of this kind: In which case the Bishop shall take care that what was so appointed, be fulfilled: Or if that cannot be, he shall (as is aforesaid) order it as well as he can to the best advantage. And therefore if all those before mentioned, and all others, of whatsoever Order or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious House or Dignity they be of, although Laymen, who have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hospitals, but are not subject to the Regulars, where the usage of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars is in force, being admonished by the Ordinary of the Duty of Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and having all things necessary for the maintaining of it, do yet in reality leave it off; they may be thereunto compelled, not only by Ecclesiastical Censures, but by other Remedies in Law, and shall be also put out of the Government of the said Hospitals for ever, and others put into their places, by those who have the power to do it. And the said persons that are put out, are nevertheless bound in conscience to make restitution of the profits which they have receiv'd, contrary to the first intent and design of the said Hospitals, for which no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, release or composition should be allowed. And the Rule or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any such like places, shall not henceforwards be given to one and the same person longer then for three years, unless it be otherwise ordered in the Statutes of the Foundation. All Agreements, Exemptions and Customs, though beyond the memory of man, and all Priviledges and Indulgences whatsoever, as is aforesaid, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

                     <p>AS it is not just to take away the Lawful Rights of the Patrons, or to violate the Wills of the Faithful in their settling of Benefices, so also it is not to be suffer'd, that upon this pretence Ecclesiastical Benefices should be brought under subjection, as is by many imprudently done. And therefore that a right course may be observ'd in all, the Holy Synod doth Decree, That the Title of the <hi>Jus Patronatus,</hi> or Patronage, shall be shewed from the Foundation, or first Donation, out of some authentick Record, or otherwise as by Law is requir'd. Whether it hath continued by many Presentations for along time beyond the memory of man, and such other ways as the Law doth appoint. But in those Persons or Communities, wherein that Right is for the most part wont to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd or presum'd from a long usage or practice, a fuller and more exact Proof shall be requir'd to the setting forth a true Title. Nor shall the Proof of its being time out of mind help them any further, than as the Presentation (besides all other things requisite to make good the said Proof) can be prov'd by authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Records, to have been continued for the space of Fifty years at least, and that they all took effect. All other Patronages in Benefices, as well Secular as Regular, whether Parochial or Dignities, or whatsoever Benefices they be, in Cathedral or Collegiat Churches, or whether they be Licenses, and Priviledges granted as well against the power of the Patrons, as for any other right what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of naming, choosing, and presenting unto the said Benefices, whenever they became vacant, (except such Patronages, as appertain to Cathedral Churches, and also except those that do belong to the Emperor, and Kings, or such as have Regal Power, and other Supreme Princes, having Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in their own Dominions, and whatsoever are granted in favour of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral studies) shall be wholly abrogated and made void, together with the Possession thereupon given to any person whatsoever. And such Benefices as these may be conferr'd upon others, as if they were void, and the Provisions that are made shall be of full force and virtue. Moreover, it shall be lawful for the Bishop, to refuse all such as are presented by the Patrons, if they are not fit to be admitted.</p>
                     <p>But if the Institution belong to <hi>Inferior persons,</hi> they may be examined by the Bishop according to the Decrees, that are elsewhere made by this Holy Synod: Otherwise the Institution that is given by Inferiors shall be void and of no effect. And the Patrons of Benefices, of what Order or Dignity soever they be, though Societies, Universities, or Colledges of Clergy-men or Lay-men, shall upon no cause or pretence whatsoever, concern themselves in the Receiving the Profits, Rents, or Revenues of any Benefices whatsoever, although they were truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the Right of Patronage, from the very first Founding and Endowing of them; but they shall freely leave them to be disposed of by the Rector or Beneficiary, any custom whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding. Neither shall they presume to transfer the said Right of Presentation upon others, under pretence of selling it, or upon any other title whatsoever, contrary to the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Laws. Whosoever doth otherwise, shall be liable to Excommunication,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102311:97"/>and the being Interdicted, and deprived of the said Right of Presentation upon that very account.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Augmentations that are made unto Churches subject to <hi>Jus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronatus,</hi> (tho of Lay-men) by uniting of free Benefices together, whether they be Parish Churches or any other Benefices whatsoever, even such as are simple, or else Dignities, or belonging to some Hospital, they shall be so ordered and settled, that the free Benefices shall be of the same nature with those to which they are annexed, and continue under the same Right of Patronage.</p>
                     <p>If these have not hitherto fully taken effect, or shall be hereafter made at the Request of any, by what Authority soever they are granted, though it be by the Apostolical See; let them together with the uniting of them, be accounted as surreptitiously obtain'd, what form of words or derogations soever they are put in shall wholly cease; but the Benefices themselves that are united, when they are void, shall be freely bestowed as they were in times past. But their Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been made within Forty Years last past, and (have gotten a full effective Incorporation) or may yet by the Ordinaries as Delegates of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick See, be receiv'd and examined into, and those which they find to have been surreptitiously or fraudulently obtain'd, shall be declared void, and the Benefices themselves be divided and conferr'd upon others. In like manner, whatsoever Patronages in Churches or in any other Benefices, and even in Dignities before free, if gotten within Forty Years last past, and whatsoever shall be obtain'd for the future, either by the addition of some new endowment, or by the new building, or any like means, though it be done by the Authority of the Apostolick See, they shall be diligently lookt into by the same Ordinaries as Delegates, as is aforesaid, and those shall in no wise be hindred from doing it, by the Faculties or Priviledges of any one. And whatsoever they find not to have been lawfully settled, upon some evident want thereof, in the Church Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice or Dignity, they shall wholly revoke it, and bring back the Benefices of that Nature without the damage of the present Incumbents, restoring that to the Patrons which was given by them to that purpose, into that condition of Freedom they were formerly in; any Priviledges, Constitutions or Customs, though beyond the memory of man, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

                     <p>FOrasmuch as by reason of the malicious suggestion of Clients or Suiters, and sometimes by reason of the distance of places, the knowledge of those persons to whose management Causes are intrusted, cannot easily be had, and hence sometimes Causes are delegated to such Judges as are not altogether fit to determine the same: The Holy Synod hath appointed, that in every Provincial or Diocesan Synod, some persons who are fitly qualified, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, which begins <hi>Statutum,</hi> shall be appointed for that purpose; that Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Causes, and such as pertain to the Ecele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Court, may be henceforth assigned to be determin'd, severally by them as well as by the Ordinaries of the Place. And if any one of those that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed happen to dye, the Ordinary of the place, with the advice of the Chapter,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102311:98"/>shall appoint another in his stead to continue till the next Provincial or Diocesan Synod. So that every Diocess shall have at least four or more approved persons, and qualified as abovesaid, to whom causes of that Nature shall be assign'd by every Legat or Nuncio, and even by the Apostolick See it self: otherwise after any Deputation that is made, which the Bishops shall forthwith transmit to his Holiness, any delegations whatsoever which are made of other Judges, than those made by the Bishops, shall be adjudged Surreptitious. And the holy Synod doth exhort as well Ordinaries as all other Judges whatsoever, that they henceforth diligently endeavour, to determine all Causes with as much speed as possibly they can, and to hinder as much as in them lies those Tricks or Knaveries which Suitors, Clients, or such as go to Law do commonly use, either in the carrying on their Suit, or in putting off any part of the Judges Sentence or Lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, either by fixing a set time for the ending of it, or by some other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient way.</p>

                     <p>IT is usually a very great Prejudice to Churches when the Revenues that belong to them are for the lucre of ready money farmed out to others, to the disadvantage of such as succeed in the said Churches. And therefore all such farmings out, if done upon the account of some moneys paid in hand, shall not be adjudged good, being to the prejudice of the Successors, any Indulgence or Priviledge to the contrary notwithstanding; nor shall such bargains be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed either in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere. Neither shall it be lawful to let out any Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction, or the Power of naming or deputing Vicars in Spiritual matters; Nor shall such as have taken those Jurisdictions execute the same, either by themselves or any other. All Grants, that are made in any other manner, though by the Apostolick See, shall be deemed surreptitious. And those farmings out of Ecclesiastick Revenues, which have been confirmed by the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See, the holy Synod doth decree to be null and of no force, if they have been done within thirty years last past, either for a long time, as they call it, or as in some places they are granted for nine and twenty, or nine and forty years. And the Provincial Synod, or such as they shall appoint, shall adjudge them to be contracted or agreed upon contrary to the Canons of Holy Church.</p>

                     <p>THey are not to be suffer'd, who by divers artifices endeavour to take away or diminish those Tythes which belong to any Churches: or who presume to seize upon those Tythes which others are to pay, and convert them to their own profit; for the paying of Tythes is a debt due to God. And whosoever does not pay Tythes themselves, or hinder others from paying them, they usurp that which is none of their own, but anothers right. Wherefore the Holy Synod doth strictly require all persons of whatsoever quality or condition they be, to whom it belongs to pay Tythes, that they henceforth intirely pay the said Tythes, which they are bound to pay according to Law, to those Cathedral or other
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102311:98"/>Churches or Persons whatsoever, to whom they Legally belong. And all such persons as either themselves do withhold, or hinder others from paying their Tythes, shall be Excommunicated, and not be absolv'd from this their Offence till they have made a full Restitution for the same. And the Synod doth farther exhort all and every person whatsoever, out of that Christian Charity, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they owe unto their Pastors, that they would not think much, out of those good things that are given them by God, bountifully to relieve those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Parish-Priests whose Churches are but poor and mean, to the Glory of God, and keeping up the dignity of their Pastors who watch for their Souls.</p>

                     <p>HOW base it is, and unbecoming the very name of Clergy-men, who have devoted themselves to the Worship, and Service of God, to live in the filth of Uncleanness, and Whoredome, the thing it self doth testify to the great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the Faithful, and the dishonour of the Clerical Order. And therefore that the Ministers of the Church, may be reduced to that Continency and Purity of life which becomes them, and that the people may hence learn to reverence them the more, when they know the honest lives that they lead: The holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod doth forbid all Clergymen whatsoever, to keep any Concubines or other Women, of whom there may be the least suspicion, either in their Houses or any where else, or so much as to have any Conversation with them at all, and if they do the contrary, they shall be punished according to the Canons and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Church in that case provided. And if when they are admonish'd by their Superiours, they will not keep from those Women, they shall <hi>ipso facto</hi> be depriv'd of the third part of their Profits, Obventions, and Revenues of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifices and Pensions whatsoever they be; which said third part shall be employ'd to the building of the Church, or to some other place of Devotion. But if they still persist in their Offence, either with the same or any other Woman, thereupon they shall loose all the Profits, and advantages of their Benefices, and their Pensions, which shall be bestowed upon the places aforesaid, and shall moreover be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from having any thing to do with their Benefices, or from supplying their Cures, as long as the Ordinary, though as a Delegate of the Apostolick See, shall think fit; and if when they are thus suspended they do not put away their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but do still keep company with them; then shall they for ever be depriv'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102311:99"/>of all Ecclesiastical Benefices, Dividends, Offices and Pensions whatsoever, and be for the future made incapable and unworthy of all Preferments, Dignities, Benefices and Offices whatsoever, until after manifest reforming of their lives, their Superiours shall think fit to dispence with them. But if after they have once put away their Women, they shall presume to return unto their former course of life, and to keep company with other scandalous Women, they shall besides the forementioned Punnishments suffer Excommunication. And no Appeal or Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall hinder or suspend the executing of the said punishment. And the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance or examination of the matters aforesaid, shall not belong to Archdeacons or Deans or other Inferior Officers, but to the Bishops themselves, who may proceed without noising it abroad or formal Process, by only inspecting the Truth of the matter of Fact.</p>
                     <p>But Clergy-men not having Ecclesiastical Benefices or Pensions, shall by the Bishop himself be punished, according to the nature of the Offence, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of the Offenders, either by Imprisonment, Suspension, or making them incapable of holding any other Benefices, or any other ways allowed of by the Holy Canons of the Church. And Bishops also (which God forbid) if they abstain not from such like offences, and being admonish'd by the Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, do not amend, they shall <hi>(ipso facto)</hi> be suspended; and if they still persist therein, they shall by the appointment of the same Synod be carried to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, who shall punish them according to the nature of their Crimes, even with Deprivation; if needful.</p>

And it doth further exhort the Emperours and Kings, Commonwealths, Princes, and all others, of whatsoever Condition or Quality they be, that by how much the more plentifully they are adorn'd with all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things, and with power and authority over others, by so much they the more Religiously do respect those things which belong unto the Church, as being Gods Propriety, and under his Protection, and not suffer them to be injur'd, or diminish'd by any of your Barons, Lords, Ladies, Governours, or other Temporal Lords or Magistrates, and more especially, not by the immediate Officers and Dependants of Princes, but severely punish all those who shall obstruct the Liberty, Freedom, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Church, to whom Princes themselves should be examples of Piety, Religion, and of Protecting the Church, imitating those most Excellent and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Princes their Predecessours, who by their Authority and Bounty, did principally augment the Revenues of the Church; and also protected them from being wrong'd by any others. Let every one so diligently do his Duty in that particular, that the Service of God may be devoutly performed, and the Prelates and other Clergymen may be enabled to continue in their place of Residence, and in the discharging of their Respective Duties, peaceably and quietly without let or hindrance, to the benefit and edification of Gods people.</p>

                  <p>WHereas the power of granting Indulgences is by Christ committed to his Church, and the Church from all Antiquity hath us'd that power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath intrusted her; the Holy Synod doth Teach and Command the use of Indulgences, as very wholsome and profitable for Christian people, and that it ought to be continued in the Church, as being approved of by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Holy Councils, and doth Anathematize those that shall affirm they are unprofitable, or deny the Churches power of granting them. And yet the Holy Synod doth desire to keep that Moderation in granting them, which hath been the ancient and approved Custom of the Church, lest by too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Discipline of the Church should be weakned, or destroyed. And being desirous that those Abuses which have crept into them, (and have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Hereticks to speak Scandalously of the excellent name of Indulgences) should be corrected and amended: It doth in general by this present Decree command, That all unlawful Gains, for the obtaining of them (which have been the great cause of many abuses among Christian people) be wholly abolish'd: As for the other Abuses which have proceeded from Superstition, Ignorance, Irreverence, or by any other means whatsoever; since by reason of the manifold Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the places or Provinces where they are committed, there cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be made any Special Prohibition against them; the Holy Synod doth command all Bishops, diligently to take account of all in every particular Church, and report them at the first Provincial Synod, that shall be held after the Knowledge of them, that the opinions of the other Bishops being known, they may forthwith be referred to the Pope, who by his Authority and Prudence may order what is fit for the Church in general, and the Gift of Holy Indulgences may be Piously, Holily, and Incorruptibly dispensed to all the Faithful.</p>

                  <p>THE Holy Synod doth further exhort, and by the most holy coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, doth beseech all Pastors, that as good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (of Jesus Christ) they would diligently recommend to all the Faithful, the observing of all those things which the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Mother and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of all Churches, hath appointed; and also those things which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in this present Council, and in all other General Councils; and that they would use their utmost endeavours to make them obedient to all, but especially to those which tend to the Mortifying of the Flesh, as the difference or choice of Meats, and Fastings, and those things likewise which promote Piety, as the Devout and Religious observing of Festivals, frequently admonishing all people to be obedient to those that are set over them; to whom whoever give ear as they ought, 'tis as if they did hearken to God, who will certainly reward them: But those who despise and contemn their Counsel, shall by God himself be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly punished.</p>

                  <p>THE Holy Synod, in the 2d Session held under our Most Holy Lord, <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the Fourth, did appoint certain Fathers chosen for that purpose, to consider what was fittest to be done about divers Censures and Books that were either Suspicious or Dangerous, and to report it to this Holy Synod; and now hearing that they have finish'd that Business, and yet by reason of the great variety and multitude of Books, it cannot conveniently be examin'd and look'd into by the Holy Synod; it doth command that what they have done shall be shewn to his Holiness, that by his Judgment and Authority it may be ended and published. And the Holy Synod commands the same to be done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechism, the Missal, and the Breviary.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the place of Ambassadours.</head>
                  <p>THE Holy Synod doth declare, That in their assigning of places to Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, whether Ecclesiastick or Secular, either for their fitting or going, or any other thing whatsoever, that is to be done by them; no prejudice to any of their Rights was thereby intended, but all the Rights and Prerogatives of them and of their Emperours, Kings, Republicks and Princes shall remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and safe, and in the same state and condition as they were before this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Council.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the Receiving and observing the Decrees of the Council.</head>
                  <p>THE state of the present times hath been so miserable and calamitous, and the malice of Hereticks so inveterate, that nothing hath been so clearly and firmly decreed in asserting our Faith, which they (by the Instigation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Enemy of Mankind) have not polluted by some Errour or other; for which reason the Holy Synod hath Condemn'd and Anathematiz'd the chief Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Hereticks of this Age, and hath deliver'd and taught the true and Catholick Doctrine, according as it did Condemn, Anathematize, and Decree against the former.</p>
                  <p>And seeing so many Bishops that are called, or chosen, out of divers parts of the Christian World, cannot without great damage and general endangering to the Flocks committed to their charge, be longer absent from their Churches; and since there is no hopes that the Hereticks which have been so often invited, upon the publick Faith which they themselves desired, and have been so long waited for, will hereafter come hither; there is therefore now a Necessity of putting an end to this Holy Council. It only remains that it should exhort in the Lord, and admonish all Princes, as it hereby does; so to discharge their
